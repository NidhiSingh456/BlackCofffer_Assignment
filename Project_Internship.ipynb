conference in  right after the world had avoided the ebola outbreak when the new unprecedented invisible virus hit us it met an overwhelmed and unprepared healthcare system and oblivious population this public health emergency demonstrated our lack of scientific consideration and underlined the alarming need for robust innovations in our health and medical facilities for the past few years artificial intelligence has proven to be of tangible potential in the healthcare sectors clinical practices translational medical and biomedical researchafter the first case was detected in china on december st  it was an ai program developed by bluedot that alerted the world about the pandemic it was quick to realise ais ability to analyse large chunks of data could help in detecting patterns and identifying and tracking the possible carriers of the virusmany tracing apps use ai to keep tabs on the people who have been infected and prevent the risk of crossinfection by using ai algorithms that can track patterns and extract some features to classify or categorise themso how does ai do thatibm watson a sophisticated ai that works on cloud computing and natural language processing has prominently contributed to the healthcare sector on a global level being a conversational ai since  watson has helped in recommending treatments to patients suffering from cancer to ensure that they get the best treatment at optimum costsresearchers at google inc showed that an ai system can be trained on thousands of images to achieve physicianlevel sensitivityby identifying the molecular patterns associated with disease status and its subtypes gene expression and protein abundance levels machine learning methods can detect fatal diseases like cancer at an early stage machine learning ml techniques focus mainly on analyzing structured data which can further help in clustering patients traits and infer the probability of disease outcomes since patient traits mainly include masses of data relating to age gender disease history diseasespecific data like diagnostic imaging and gene expressions etc ml can extract features from these data inputs by constructing data analytical algorithmsml algorithms are either supervised or unsupervised unsupervised learning helps in extracting features and clustering similar features together that further leads to early detection of diseases clustering and principal component analysis enable grouping or clustering of similar traits together that are further used to maximize or minimize the similarity between the patients within or between the clusters since patient traits are recorded in multiple dimensions such as genes principal component analysispca creates the apparatus to reduce these dimensions which humans could have not done alonesupervised learning considers the outcomes of the subjects together with the traits and further correlates the inputs with the outputs to predict the probability of getting a particular clinical event expected value of a disease level or expected survival time or risk of downs syndromebiomarker panels that are mostly used to detect ovarian cancer have outperformed the conventional statistical methods due to machine learning in addition to this the use of ehrs and bayesian networks which are a part of supervised machine learning algorithms can predict clinical outcomes and mortality respectivelyunstructured data such as clinical notes and texts are converted into machinereadable structured data with the help of natural language processingnlp nlp works with two components text processing and classification text processing helps in identifying a series of diseaserelevant keywords in clinical notes and then through classification are further categorized into normal and abnormal cases chest screening through ml and nlp has helped find abnormalities in the lungs and provide treatment to covid patients healthcare organizations use nlpbased chatbots to increase interactions with patients keeping their mental health and wellness in checkdeep learning is a modern extension of the classical neural network techniques which helps explore more complex

widely considered in most delicate surgeries like gynaecology and prostate surgery even after striking the right balance between human decisions and ai precision robotic surgery reduces surgeon efficiency as they have to be manually operated through a console thus autonomous robotic surgery is on the rise with inventions such as robotic silicon fingers that mimic the sense of touch that surgeons need to identify organs cut tissues etc or robotic catheters that can navigate whether it is touching blood tissue or valveresearchers at childrens national hospital washington have already developed an ai called smart tissue autonomous robot star which performs a colon anastomosis on its own with the help of an mlpowered suturing tool that automatically detects the patients breathing

costs through this technology doctors and various healthcare workers have access to detailed patient data that helps in speeding up analysis ultimately leading to better care in the form of more accurate information medications and therapieshow can it help in biomedical researchsince ai can analyze literature beyond readability it can be used to concise biomedical research with the help of ml algorithms and nlp ai can accelerate screening and indexing of biomedical research by ranking the literature of interest which allows researchers to formulate and test scientific hypotheses far more precisely and quickly taking it to the next level ai systems like the computational modelling assistant cma helps researchers to construct simulation models from the concepts they have in mind such

monetarily enticing it is evolving with artificial sensors smart technologies and explores everything from braincomputer interfaces to nanorobotics companies with their smartwatches have engaged people to perform remote monitoring even when they are not patients an obvious place to start is with wearable and embedded sensors glucose monitors pulse monitors oximeters and ecg monitors with patient monitoring becoming crucial ai finds numerous applications in chronic conditions intensive care units operating rooms emergency rooms and cardiac wards where timeless clinical decisionmaking can be measured in seconds more advances have started to gain traction like smart prosthetics and implants these play an impeccable role in patient management postsurgery or rehabilitation demographics laboratory results and vital signs can also be used to predict cardiac arrest transfer into the intensive care unit or even death in addition an interpretable machinelearning model can assist anesthesiologists in predicting hypoxaemia events during surgery this suggests that with deeplearning algorithms raw patientmonitoring data could be better used to avoid information overload and alert overload while enabling more accurate clinical prediction and timely decisionmakingconclusionconsidering the vast range of tasks that an ai can do it is evident that it holds deep potential in improving patient outcomes to skyrocketing levels using sophisticated algorithms ai can bring a revolution in the healthcare sector even after facing challenges like whether the technology will be able to deliver the promises ethical measures training physicians to use it standard regulations etc the role of ai in transforming the clinical practices cannot be ignored the biggest challenge is the integration of ai in daily practice all of these can be overcome and within that period the technologies will mature making the system far more enhanced and effectiveblackcoffer insights  sanskriti sunderum and aayushi nauhwar srcc delhi university', 'human minds a fascination in itself carrying the potential of tinkering nature with the pixie dust intelligence creating and solving the mysteries and wonders with anything but admiration however no matter how captivating a human mind can be it could sometimes be appalled it could be the hunger or maybe the desire to want more to go beyond and unravel the limitations or maybe something like pure greed humans have never stopped and always keep evolving when it comes to intelligence and this is what makes them the supremeintelligence calls out for supremacy and so what if there was to evolve something that opposed a challenge to the very human minds to their capabilities while making them question their own importance among themselves artificial intelligence came as a revolution havoc when it first came to the light the concept of making machines does work on their own like granting machines the intelligencethe idea of making machines work like humans came back in the s back then people didnt believe in such a thing as making a nonliving thing work think and carry tasks on its own not to mention to actually surpass humans themselves in those skills the facts are it did by  the greatest chess player garry kasparov was defeated in a chess game by a machine and this is where exactly a top skilled human lost to a mere machine created by another who by himself couldve never defeated him it was a rule of power of betterment of skills and the granted supremacy were ai and machines just tools equipment something that helped an unskilled person with his mind and intelligence creates something that could do the skilled work for him with perfection and precision well initially it was however as time passed as humans got drawn to the puzzle of ai a lot changed human research went deeper and deeper and as a result the machines evolved with itat present ai  machines is a growing field as it develops and improves it has become a part of the industrial revolution in industries most of the laborious work that was once taken care of by humans was now replaced by machines naturally with the evolution in machines its precision mass productivity quality control time efficiencies and all the other factors made it a better choice a choice over humansthis led to fear a fear of a notsodistant future a future where maybe machines will be so evolved that theyll take over the need of a human employee leading to unemployment with the population increase around the world it became the new tech threat for the labor market then again how true is it does ai really oppose a threat will adapting to technology make millions of people lose their jobs will it lead to mass unemployment will the machines really surpass humans will the creation take over the creatorno matter how fearful the future with ai may seem in reality it is not that scary truth is ai is the present reality it is the key that holds the power to unlock a whole next level of human evolution technology is growing there was a time where technology was just an idea but today that idea has been implemented its working and is carried out nobody could stop the advancement and growth of artificial intelligence its a wave that is already flowing and we as the present generation and the generations to come to have to learn to learn to swim in this flow and avoid drowningmany jobs will be replaced by machines as ai evolves itll keep challenging human minds and their skills with the present covid  situation contactless cashiers to robots delivering packages have already taken over the usual routine tasks the jobs of secretaries schedulers and bookkeeper are at risk too manufacturing units agriculture food services retail transportation  logistic and hospitality are all a part of the aiaffected automation at an estimation it is said that around  million jobs especially including manufacturing will be lost to robots as ai robotics d printing and genetics make their way in even the architects medical docs and music composers feel threatened by technology making us question that will ai even edge us out of our brain jobs too now that can be terrifyinghowever as much as machines will be replacing few jobs theyll also be creating new jobs with the economic growth innovation and investment around  million jobs are said to be generated these newly enhanced jobs are to create benefits and amplify ones creativity strategy and entrepreneurial skills so what is the catchwell its the skills even though ai is creating  times more jobs than it is destroying its the skills that count ai surged in new job opportunities opportunities like senior data scientist mobile application developer and seo specialist these jobs were once never heard of but now with ai its born however to do these jobs or for its qualification one needs highlevel skills and to acquire those skills can be an expensive and timeconsuming task the future generation might be able to cope up with it but the real struggle is to be faced by the present two generations its the vulnerability between the skill gap and unemployment and the youths are the ones to be crushed the mosttherefore as the advancement of ai becomes inevitable there remains no choice but to adapt learn equip ourselves and grow with it the companies have to work together to build an aiready workplace they should collaborate with the government educators and nonprofit organizations and work together to bring out policies that could help understand the technologies impacts faster while also providing the employees some security the economic and business planning should be made considerable for minimizing the impact on local jobs and properly maximizing the opportunitiesthe employees should be provided with proper tools to carry along with the new opportunities while acquiring aibased skills for their daytoday work new skills should be identified and implemented for the upskilling and continual learning initiatives employees will have to maximize their robotic quotient and learn core skills theyll have to adapt to new working models and understand their roles in the coming futurehowsoever its not like ai will totally take over control even though ai proves to be a better choice it still has its limitations at present first its expensive secondly manufacturing machines in bulk is not good for the environment machines are also very high maintenance therefore human labor will often come cheaper and so will be considered over machines underdeveloped countries will find it hard to equip their people with the upskilling and reskilling required for ai workplace and so for ai to play a role in those countries might take years ai can also be risky and unethical as its hard to figure out who to be held responsible for in cases where an ai went wrongno matter how advanced ai gets there are some skills where humans will always have an upper hand ie soft skills skills like teamwork communication creativity and critical thinking are something that ai hasnt been able to beat us up to yet and so the value of creativity leadership and emotional intelligence has increased although with machines coming in between humans causing the lack of humantohuman interaction the humans seem to fade away a littlewith this era comes the need for good leaders leaders who are capable of handling both machines and humans together the ones who are organized enough to manage the skilled and the unskilled employees while providing the unskilled trainees with proper training leaders who hold profound soft skills and encourage teamwork while working along with machines the ones who are patient calm and optimized in conclusion yes ai and machines are going to be very challenging but theres nothing humans havent overcome adaptation and upgradation are going to be the primary factor for survival as we witness the onset of the th industrial revolution lets buckle up our seats and race along the highway with the essential fuels skills so as to not let ourselves eliminated after all

'introductionai is rapidly evolving in the employment sector particularly in matters involving business and finance finance management economics and accounting are now among the most popular university courses globally particularly at the graduate level due to their high employability however the evolution of machinery in industries is changing that according to research  jobs in these sectors may be replaced by ai agents in the next  years this is due to the nature of the work as employees are responsible for tasks such as data analysis and keeping track of numerical information which machines excel at large complicated data sets can be analyzed faster and more efficiently by aipowered computers than by people algorithmic trading procedures that produce automated deals are less likely to be produced without minute errors when undertaken by humans in such matters involving industrial work a subsection of artificial intelligence is used namely machine learningmachine learning is a term used for the application of artificial intelligence ai in systems which involves them assimilating and processing information by gaining experience it is mainly concerned with the development of technology and computer programsits improvement process is mainly divided into seven steps which start with the collection of data this data can be collected from an internal database or perhaps an iot structure the second and most timeconsuming step is cleaning preparing and rearranging the data which involves the recognition of outliers trends and missing information so that the outcome is as accurate as possible the third step consists of formatting data which is useful if you source your information from a variety of sources step four is where ai comes into place selfservice data processing tools may be useful if they provide intelligent services for matching data attributes from distinct databases and intelligently integrating them the data is then arranged to better represent a specific pattern lastly the data is divided into two sets one for training the algorithm and one for analysisthere are three types of machine learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning the most common of the bunch is supervised machine learning which is based on accurately labeled data the machine is given a collection of information including the outcome of the operation the rest of the information is referred to as input features which supervises the machine by guiding it to establish the connections between the variantsin the case of unsupervised learning the machine isnt given labeled sets of data to be divided into allowing it to recognize and create its own patterns within the information provided since computers have the capabilities of identifying distinguished similarities this method helps with the classifying of such datareinforcement learning comprises experiencebased learning similar to people they learn due to a reward and punishment system based on their actionsthese variations of system learning have recently been integrated into business and finance which is elaborated on in the following passagesmachine learning in finance and bankingthere are many ways in which machine learning is used in finance and banking the most common place it is used is to detect any frauds fraud is the most common problem in financial service companies and it accounts for billions of dollars in misfortune each year the most common frauds are credit or debit card usage by a stranger document forgery and mortgage fraudusually finance companies keep an enormous amount of their data stored online and it increases the risk of information being accessed without authorization with expanding innovative headway misrepresentation in the monetary business is currently viewed as a high danger to significant information fraud recognition frameworks in the past were planned dependent on a bunch of rules which could be effortlessly be bypassed by current fraudsters therefore most companies today leverage machine learning to combat fraudulent financial transactionsmachine learning works by looking over enormous informational indexes to distinguish unique or suspicious activities for additional examination by security groups it works by looking at an exchange against other information focuses  like the clients record history ip address area and so forth depending on the type of exchange taking place the program can automatically refuse a withdrawal or purchase until the person makes a decisionexamples of fraud detection software used by banks include feedzai data visor and teradatamachine learning is also used in algorithmic trading portfolio management loan underwriting chatbots and improving customer servicealgorithmic trading is an interaction for executing orders using computerized and premodified exchanging guidelines to represent factors like value timing and volume an algorithm is a set of directions for solving a problem computer calculations send little parts of the full request to the market over the long runin contrast to human dealers algorithmic exchanging can investigate enormous volumes of information every day and therefore make thousands of trades every day machine learning settles on quick exchanging choices which gives human traders a benefit over the market normal likewise algorithmic exchanging doesnt settle on exchanging choices dependent on feelings which is a typical constraint among human dealers whose judgment might be influenced by feelings or individual desires the exchanging technique is generally utilized by multifaceted investment administrators and monetary foundations to automate trading activitiesin the banking industry organizations access a large number of shopper information with which machine learning can be prepared to work in order to simplify the underwriting process machine learning calculations can settle on speedy choices on endorsing and credit scoring and save organizations both time and monetary assets that are utilized by peopledata scientists can train algorithms on how to analyze millions of consumer data to coordinate with information records search for interesting special cases and settle on a choice on whether a shopper meets all requirements for an advance or protection for instance the calculation can be prepared on the most proficient method to examine shopper information like age pay occupation and the buyers credit conductthe benefits of machine learningas with any form of revolutionary technology the usage of machine learning has been debated over as its beneficial properties have been weighed against the possible disadvantages its been observed that upon correct usage it may be used to solve a wide range of business challenges and anticipate complicated customer behavior weve also seen several of the largest it conglomerates such as google amazon and microsoft introduce cloud machine learning platformstechnology vs human intelligencein terms of business ml can aid businesses by identifying consumers demands and formulate a pattern based on them allowing companies to reach out to such consumers and maximize their sales it eliminates the need for expenses on some maintenance by reducing the risks associated with unexpected breakdowns and minimizes wasteful costs to the firms historical data a process visualization tool a flexible analytical environment and a feedback loop may all be used to build an ml architecture the input of data is another agitating chore for businesses in the present which is where machine learning can step in for manual labor this eradicates the possibility of errors caused by manual labor causing disruptions and provides employees with extra time to handle other tasksin the financial sector machine learning is already utilized for portfolio management algorithmic trading loan underwriting and fraud detection chatbots and other conversational interfaces for security customer support and sentiment analysis will be among the future uses of ml in banking another aspect of business involving artificial intelligence includes image recognition which entails a system or program that recognizes objects people places and movements in photos it identifies photographs using an imaging system and machine recognition tech with artificial intelligence and programmed algorithmsthe downfalls of machine learningwith all the benefits of its advancement machine learning isnt the most perfect thing there are several disadvantages which are information acquisition time and resources and high errors and wrong interpretations one of the major hurdles is the amount of finance needed to invest in machine learning for it to be a successful project more issues have to do with the fact that ai requires gigantic informational indexes to train on and these ought to be unbiased and of good quality there can likewise be times where they have to wait for that new information to be produced machine learning needs sufficient opportunity to do the calculations to learn and adequately to satisfy their accuracy and relevancy it also needs huge resources to work this can mean extra requirements for the computer to work another significant problem is the capacity to precisely decipher the results produced by the calculations you should likewise cautiously pick the algorithms to get the wanted resultsconclusionthere have been various reports in the past and current years which claim that a significant piece of the human labor force will be replaced via robots and machines in the years to come with excessive innovative work being led in the field of computerized reasoning many dread that a significant job crisis will unfurl since numerous positions are all the more precisely and productively performed with the use of machines in countries like japan mainly computer programs and ai is used in the secondary and tertiary sectors from cleaning the house to depositing money in banks everything is done by ai however ai cannot replace humans in the future humans have several capabilities which even after several technological advancements a machine would not be able to have these capabilities include creative thinking and creative problem solving and human connection for example when a child goes to a doctor to get an injection a nurse always relaxes the child to not be afraid of the needle a machines touch would not be able to soothe a child another example could be how humans tend to share things with each other and be open about it a machine will not be able to do so since it is only programmed to things it has been told to do like computers ai will not replace us but would however complement us

machine playing chess or a robot answering questions on facebook artificial intelligence can be further broken down into many different types there are ais designed to do specific tasks such as detecting a specific type of cancer however there are also ais that can do multiple tasks such as driving a car there are many types of ais among the top most important fields are machine learning or ml neural network computer vision and natural language processing or nlpmachine learning is the idea of machines being able to prove themselves similar to how a human being learns a new skill machine

that computers have visions this allows them to see things the way human beings do or potentially better than human beings do depending on the programming camera used etc computer vision is used in autonomous vehicles for navigation from one place to anothernatural language processing is the idea that computers can listen to what we say an example of this is siri siri is able to listen to our demands process what it means and provide you an answer based on what is researchednow that we know what an ai is and what it can do lets talk about the issuewill machine replace the human in the future of work  ais allow for the automation of jobs thereby replacing what humans already do this means more job loss and the concentration of wealth to the selected few people this could mean a destabilization of society and social unrest in addition to social unrest ai improves over time this means it becomes smarter faster and cheaper to implement and it will be better at doing repetitive things that humans currently do such as preparing fast food it is predicted that ai will improve so much over  to  years that ai will become super intelligent this means that it will become even smarter than the most intelligent human on earth according to many experts such as elon musk this could cause the end of human civilization ai could potentially start a war against humans burn crops and do all sorts of tragedies once reserved for human functions at that point in theory we can not stop it because ai would have already thought of all the obstacles that will prevent its goal this means that we cannot unplug the machine in effect ai will replace human intelligencebut will this happen in next  to  yearsno the field of artificial intelligence is sophisticated enough to do many human tasks that humans currently do currently ai is not smart enough to be empathetic to humans and cannot think strategically enough to solve complex problems ai solutions can be expensive and have to go through many different tests and standards to implement it also takes time for ai to improve for example boston dynamics one of the worlds top robotics company had a robot in  that needed assistance to walk fast forward to  not only the robot could walk by itself but it could jump over objects do backflips and so much more in addition to the timing it takes time for the price of any new technological solution to drop to a point where it is affordable for example a desktop computer costs around  in  but now you can get a significantly more powerful laptop for the exact same price ai will go through the same curvebut what happens after those  to  years will ai make human intelligence obsolete maybe as we have proven earlier ai will become faster better and cheaper as this happens more and more companies will use ai technology to automate more and more jobs to save money increase productivity and most importantly stay competitive as we have demonstrated ai will become better through repetition via the use of machine learning the only difference is that ai will be able to learn faster as time progresses due to the amount of data that is available today it will also be able to learn from other machines or similar machines to learn how to optimize its tasks or new important skills however ai also just not do repetitive and routine tasks better it will also be able to understand emotional intelligence ethics and creativity this seen in three distinct example ibmibm uses its ibm watson to program the ai to create a movie trailer fox approached ibm and said they have a movie coming out on ai scifi horror they asked ibm if their platform ibm watson could a trailer by reviewing and watching the footage and searching for scarywill machine replace the human in

able to generate a trailer for the movie morgan the result a movie trailer created by machines example  googlein  google demonstrated an ai assistance that could take calls and do simple stuff the ai was able to set up an appointment what was more fascinating was that it was able to understand the nuances of the conversation the receptionist thought it was a human being that was calling her that is a very primitive version of what is possible with this technology eventually it will be able to have conversations just as human beings do making many sales jobs obsolete example  ai generated

researchers at oxford university did a study on the future of work they concluded that almost one in every two jobs have a high risk of being automated by machines machine learning is responsible for this disruption it is the most powerful branch of artificial intelligence it allows machines to learn from data and mimic some of the things that humans can doa research was conducted by the employees of kaggle wherein an algorithm was to be created to take images of a human eye and diagnose an eye disease known as diabetic retinopathy here the winning algorithm could match the diagnosis given by human ophthalmologists another study was conducted wherein an algorithm should be created to grade high school essays here too the winning algorithm could match the grade given by human teachersthus we can safely conclude that given the right data machines can easily outperform human beings in tasks like these a teacher might read  essays over a year career an ophthalmologist might see  eyes but a machine can read a million essays and see a million eyes within minutesthus it is convenient to conclude that we have no chance of competing with machines on frequent high volume taskstasks where machines dont workbut there are tasks where human beings have an upper hand and that is in novel tasks machines cant handle things they havent seen many times before the fundamental rule of machine

theyll be able tocut costsincrease efficienciesoffer new value propositionsexecute new business models or all of the aboveof course its not just machines and creatives working together either in another example amazon has employed more than  robots in its warehouses to efficiently move things around while it has increased its warehouse workforce by more than  humans in amazons case do the picking and packing of goods while robots move orders around the giant warehouses essentially cutting down on the walking required of workers making amazon pickers more efficient and less tired plus the robots allow amazon to pack shelves together like cars in rushhour traffic because they no longer need aisle space for humans the greater density of shelf space means more inventory under one roof which means better selection for customerswhy machines can replace humansduring the next few decades or maybe sooner the notion of work and whether it is handled by a human or a virtual being will hinge on predictability as they are starting to do today machines will manage the routine while humans take on the unpredictable  tasks that require creativity problemsolving and flexibility in this context robotics should be seen not only as a means to improve operations efficiency but also to improve the quality of life for workersalthough it is obvious that human factors involved in a work activity impact job automation it is also true that highly repetitive tasksand even mechanical onesare ideal for robots besides greater efficiency and speed automation leads to a lower risk of accidents greater control and autonomy and above all fewer costs for organizationsare machines more diligent than humansalthough artificial intelligence and machine learning make us believe that robots are endowed with superior intelligence in fact they dont yet have the ability to learn from experience and to respond to unknowns so as things stand however much processing speed and automatic learning a robot has it doesnt beat factors innate to the human brain humans are still a very essential part of the process think about delivering services to a client most customer challenges are routine but humans play a very important role in addressing new issues solving them the first time they appear and then consolidating the process into the systemmachines vs humans  which is premiumwhile machines and humans are placed in proximity robots can be expensive but this doesnt apply to all types especially those based on robotic process automation rpa where the development process incorporates algorithms that significantly reduce costsmoreover think of how domestic robotsbe it a vacuum cleaner a lawn mower or a pool cleanerare increasingly part of our daily lives this level of consumption that robotics has attained makes it affordable to automate tasks in modern homes to obtain greater control security and comfortman and machines togetherthe division between humans and machines has been clear  im here the machine is there  but that boundary is getting fuzzier smart prosthetics fuse seamlessly with our bodies making up for lost limbs or providing additional strength stability or resilience as seen in exoskeletons donned by assembly line workerswe use our smartphones symbiotically but what if they were integrated directly into our bodies think a smartphone in the form of a contact lens capable of transparently delivering augmented reality images straight to the brain think it sounds like science fiction think again the first prototypes have already been builtsoon braincomputer interfaces could become seamless as well creating a new synergistic relationship between the cloud and us at that point the question of who knows what would be moot you ask me a question and i know the answer sometimes that answer will be stored in my own neural circuitry but most of the time it would come from the connection of my neurons to the web our brains decision process is influenced by the way it has been educated by the cultural context these external factors are influencing our decision processes to the point that in certain situations we can legitimately claim that influence has been so strong that our brains cant be held accountable for the choices made the point im trying to make is that we humans are in symbiosis with our cultural environment and the tools  both physical and conceptual  that we have been taught to use my guess is that the transformation will be subtleconclusionpractically speaking robots growing to the point that they take over the world and then start creating smarter better robots are impractical and should not even be a concern none of this is expected in the near future not by a long shot if youve been to an atm waited for a pc to boot up after a catastrophic failure or had a game crash on your x box just when you were about to reach a checkpoint you understand that we are not in a world where

significantly benefit from machine learning so how does machine learning change the way businesses operatefig machine learning techniques for businessbigger upfront costsfirst things first machine learning needs training data and training data costs money especially training data labeled by humans let me explain to make machine learning work for business the algorithm needs to see lots and lots of examples of what its supposed to be doing if you want an algorithm to tell you if a sales lead is good you need to show it lots and lots of examples of good sales leads and bad sales leads if you want an algorithm to tag the support tickets you need to show it many examples of support tickets if you localize your algorithm to a new language you probably need to collect lots of examples in that language in some instances a company may have those training sets inhouse for example a bunch of disqualified or qualified leads but say you havent labeled each of your support tickets as theyve come in over the year youd need to have people either inhouse or en masse via a data enrichment platform label those tickets the machine will then look at those judgments and start finding connections and patterns it can learn frommuch lower ongoing costsmachine learning is much cheaper and more efficient than people when it works well the downside is that it often works well in  percent of the cases and badly in  percent of the cases and lowering the  percent error rate is hard if not impossible but even an  percent accurate algorithm can save you a lot of money because good machine learning algorithms know where they are accurate and where they are more likely to have errors smart companies take the cases where the algorithm has high confidence and uses those directly while sending low confidence cases to humans banks have been doing this for years when you put a check in an atm an algorithm tries to decipher the numbers on the check if you have really sloppy handwriting or the ink is smudged the algorithm passes the task to a human this design pattern saves banks lots of money while preserving a very high level of accuracyyour costs will drop over timea huge benefit of machine learning is that it can turn part of your variable cost into more of a fixed cost if you use humans to handle cases where that algorithm is struggling you are creating the perfect training data to feed into your algorithm this is a wellstudied technique called active learning it turns out that training data labels collected on cases where the algorithm has low confidence help the algorithm learn much much more efficientlyas the algorithm becomes increasingly more accurate the unit economics of your business process become better and as machine learning becomes able to handle more cases the expensive humans are only called in on the toughest rarest situations that means you use the best of both human and machine intelligence in tandem leveraging the speed and reliability of computers for the easy judgments and the fluency and expertise of humans for the difficult ones and if that sounds like smart business its because it isblackcoffer insights  monica v sns college of technology',

the advent of this technology has created fear that ai will one day make human beings obsolete in the workforce after all as technology has advanced many tasks that were once executed by human hands have become automated its only natural to fear that the leap toward creating intelligent computers could herald the beginning of the end of work as we know it but i dont think there is any reason to be so fatalistic a recent paper published by the mit task force on the work of the future entitled artificial intelligence and the future of work looked closely at developments in ai and their relation to the world of work the paper paints a more optimistic picturerather than promoting the obsolescence of human labor the paper predicts that ai will continue to drive massive innovation that will fuel many existing industries and could have the potential to create many new sectors for growth ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks there are still major limitations in particular ai programs are typically only capable of specialized intelligence meaning they can solve only one problem and execute only one task at a time often they can be rigid and unable to respond to any changes in input or perform any thinking outside of their prescribed programming humans however possess generalized intelligence with the kind of problemsolving abstract thinking and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business human judgment will be relevant if not in every task then certainly throughout every level across all sectors there are many other factors that could limit runaway advancement in ai ai often requires learning which can involve massive amounts of data calling into question the availability of the right kind of data and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data there is also the limitation of computation and processing power the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at  million another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the aithere has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade

thinking has now become a reality thanks to the technological advancement in ai in the last decadebefore diving deep into how ai can impact the future of work lets begin with the simple question whats ai artificial intelligence provides machines the power to think from data the machine uses the patterns and trends found in data and makes its decision but cannot create thought beyond these patterns and trendsfig impact of robots on employmentswith the rise of ai humans are divided into one question are machines humans friend or foe tech executives and politicians on conference stages campaign rallies and even science fiction hollywood movies like carbon black westworld minority report and ex machina have given their take on this question some believe ai will help us solve problems while others believe that the rise of ai will result in destruction and maybe the end of the world we all knowstephen hawking made it no secret of his concern about the rise of superhuman ai that eventually would escape earth to a new planet no this isnt a plot of black mirror right now superhumans may not be a reality but ai ishomo deus the emergence of the new digital god using ai god must also worry as ai might take his jobheres some career advice have you thought about being a robot the fear that ai would automate all jobs in the future eventually leaving all humans jobless has been daunting for many workers today statistics show that nearly  of workers worry about losing their jobs to robots while another thought that many people believe is that though the rise of ai with result in automating most of the jobs in the future however it also will create millions of new job opportunitiesai is already replacing most manual and repetitive tasks for example buying a metro ticket or a movie ticket is now almost a humanless interaction each year the number of industrial robot jobs increases by   at this rate its predicted that the  million jobs in the manufacturing industry will be replaced by robots due to automationthe coronavirus pandemic and recession have boosted the demand for automation the robotic process automation rpa software industry has experienced an increase of

these tools recruiters get insights into a candidates skills personality and even check whether the candidate is fit for the organization for example the company allyo first identifies highpotential candidates through assessment and smart screening and then automatically schedules interviews using ai hr departments at large companies receive hundreds of resumes for a job opening entrylevel roles focusing on screening and scheduling will be automated ai will automate specific hr jobs not hr roles a deloitte study found that ai has already eliminated  lowskilled jobs in the uk but  million new

former bookkeepers to learn skills needed to run and manage the software for employers and clients advisors are another crucial role of the accounting and finance team using the information gained from transactions in books the team creates insights to improve business strategy owing to automation the team spends more time analyzing numbersmarketing and sales marketing automation has helped companies strategize the proper utilization of the companys resources managing time and achieving budget targets marketing automation has helped to draw conclusions at a scale no marketer ever would in this process marketers and machines both excel in different parts marketers using ai tools drive more conversions in less time human intelligence with technology can help identify the right

let us know what ai is and all the fuss going on about itai as defined by the internet is simply simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions this translates to it can work as a human being just at fast speed and with  accuracyin my definition i would define ai as the god form of human beingsnow the question that arises is what does ai entails for the futureai is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers with its introduction to different areas of the workplace it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by ai and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming aibased ventures in different industries thereby giving us our fair share back to usin a survey it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and techsavvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivalspeople believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficientthe organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using ai and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higherend technology systems as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long runmany jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology beyond just training and developing these machines humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machineit can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human cant remain in the workforce without each other as the technology will produce accurate and topnotch results but it requires someone to make deliveryeg in a firm an aibased system produces results based on

but the reality seems to be turning otherwisethe future trend shows that in future the aipowered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies and so in the future we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drasticallysome of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can

the operations are carried out by aipowered technologies which is indeed a breakthrough technology in todays worldrather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs backthere will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as gen z they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the

affair at the initial stage it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around  million so this superpowered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worthone of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased reportthese machines as do not have neurosciencebased technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a

you were to ask the experts they might unwaveringly confirm that no matter all the noise ai is here to profit us all case in point an executive briefing by the mckinsey global institute revealed that ai and automation are creating opportunities for the economy society and businessthat said its time to repress the widespread idea of artificial intelligence taking jobs so lets highlight a number of the useful developments youll expect from this technological phenomenonai will create jobswhile the relationship between artificial intelligence and jobs is a matter of hot debate it is still safe to say that ai will indeed offer new opportunities according to the planet economic forum report robots and ai will create as many ai jobs as they displace this conclusion is entirely viable as it is easy to identify some of the many careers in artificial intelligence for example data scientists who evaluate the decisions made by ai algorithms to eliminate any biases apart from that some other ai occupations includetransparency analysts people tasked with classifying the varied sorts of opacity for algorithms smartsystem interaction modelers experts who develop machine behavior based on

percent of organizations were completely reliant on automation in  with repetitive tasks taken care of employees can focus their energies on highvalue customeroriented tasks and collaboration the designs of workplaces and workflows will also change with the implementation of ai technology more people will begin to figure more closely with machines as companies will strive to become more

new chapter of the society of the world that people try to understand themselves better rather than the outside world with ai because people who are naysayer and kind of try to drum up these doomsday scenarios are pretty irresponsible after all in the next five to ten years ai is going to deliver so many improvements and the quality of our lives it is a renaissance a golden age of machine learning and artificial intelligence that was the realm of science fiction for the last several decades ai is probably the most important thing humanities that have ever worked which is more profound than any work with technology as it is important to harness the benefits and while minimizing the downside is focusing on autonomous systems like selfdriving cars seen as the mother of all ai projects and has made applications like selfdriving technology viable for the first time three things happen at the same time number one data collection and data processing became easier because of better technologies right um you need data to fuel ai training and thats been one of the big drivers the second thing that has happened is that computer processing has become faster thats like the engine so no matter how much fuel you have if you dont have that engine and processing the data on a timeframe thats reasonable was just not possible and the third thing thats happened is that new algorithms have been developed which has made ai much more powerful so technology has been changing and developing at a pace thats much faster than ever before and we have not been used to this rapid pace of change which means that we have not been used to thinking about how its going to impact our immediate future the most important factor responsible for the growth of ai is google and its ai what googles done is given all of us the power to get the relevant information we want at our fingertips this has created a shift in how things are bought but it didnt happen overnight this started in  but the major change only happens to start  onwards googles taken away about  of sales peoples jobs that were primarily order takers and the ones that are remaining are likely to be gone over the next decadein present several ai projects are helping in diagnosing diseases better match up drugs with people depending on what theyre sick they can get treated better so its going to help a whole lot of people get treated and get better healthcare than would have had access to it before if you look at selfdriving cars theyre going to be safer than people driving cars and the value that machine learning is providing is actually happening beneath the surface and it is things like improved search results improved product recommendations for customers improve forecasting for inventory management and literally hundreds of other things including speechrecognition or imagerecognition that the performance levels are phenomenal or drug discovery as these biological systems are very complicated because vaccines for tb and hiv developing thats notably enabled by this rich data advanced in biology and machine learning and recent invention in which is an application we just launched for anybody with visual impairment ass it uses the latest cuttingedge computer vision technology to give anyone the ability to see so anyone who has dyslexia can now use ai to be able to read better and with the latest release of windows  has this capability called ijs which enable the eye muscle that the gaze can help to type like the two sides of the coin there are negative impacts of ai as well bill gates ellen musk also tech giants in a way their views are pessimistic to say the least they warned against the potential of ai to replace humans in the workplace and ella masks even went as far as to claim that ai is the biggest existential threat to mankind because of the loss of a job when you think about a job or a career choice if a majority of the tasks that comprise that career choice is likely to be these vulnerable tasks then that is a career at risk in the future so what are the tasks that ai will find hard to do anything unpredictable anything that requires skills like creative thinking or empathy or interpersonal skills but its important to understand tomorrow whether google is there or not artificial intelligence is going to progress you know technology has just nature its that its going to evolve as technology and in particular ai can in fact bring more empowerment more inclusiveness and at the same time it is important to be cleareyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think if theyre not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this there are different reports that have been shared by oxford study that says  of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that  of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined  participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesnt require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than realtime employees machines are faster cant be distracted and can work  this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing creative content from beginning to end by  ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs highskilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for  of the referral marketing traffic and receive more than  of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to reevaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that were about to see by  it is estimated that  to  percent of the labor force will be displaced within  to  years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a good way to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a map of how ai and automation will affect industry and company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not artificial intelligence is not a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation its too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but theyre

useful information from the given data and then take corresponding decisions based upon the analyzed dataduring the pandemic known as covid many businesses failed to grow whereas many touched the sky for example the transportation of raw materials was drastically low becausethe nationwide lockdown was imposedlow production due to a smaller number of workersstorage facilities were shut down and many more for such reasonson the other hand new businessstartups got a chance to compete in the market by getting early responses from the companies they wanted to tie up with or from the head of the companies that they wanted investments fromthe data analysis can help businesses in many ways such asusing different statistical models that are used in data analysis the businesses can predict the approximate requirement for the product in the near future and hence they can produce it accordinglyit makes it easier to track the requirement and produce the product accordinglybecause of the lockdown people had to start working from home which became a huge advantage for the businesses as they would get quicker responses from their tieupsusing data analysis businesses can create several models and structures to measure the growth of the company and also to make devised plans to increase the revenues and decrease the lossesdata analysis provides different analytical techniques such

getting canceled and a massive decrease in the global economy with a significant decrease in green house gases ghg in many developed and developing countriesthe sars cov came into the spotlight in december  and has impacted most of the countries till then nearly  million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around  million according to world health organisation who most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus these policies caused adverse effects worldwide one of the most important impacts of the covid pandemic is on the environmentthere have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like air pollution has decreased dramatically as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics air traffics rail traffics and industrial activities it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nations governments has caused people to remain back at their homes because of this the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased due to all these changes the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantiallywater pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities but the covid virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environmentto begin with some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic in the united states and in many other european nationstates waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers this has resulted in an increase in the use of singleuse plastic bags instead of the reusable bags by many leading restaurants firms and corporations for instance starbucks a leading coffee company during the month of march  has announced a shortlived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cupsfurthermore with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores shops restaurants and food outlets are closed making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually singleuse items that can be used only once before they are disposed of some of these wastes include used masks personal protection kits and gloves for instance nearly  tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan china this is  tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhanthese organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution air pollution soil erosion and can harm the local flora and faunathe demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of nonwoven fabrics polyester polystyrene polyethylene and polycarbonate are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between grams to  gramssq meter these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plasticbased products with a really high afterlife after being discarded if not treated properly without discarding they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms for example recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wasteswith recycling plants on hold piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane ch a greenhouse gas hence increasing the risk of global warming too not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods but the local people are also getting affected if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earths atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes this could result in increases in earths average temperature and can be harmful to future generationsmany protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes the employees ngos and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks marine conservation zones and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting illegal deforestation and fishing activities due to the absence of these people the prohibition of ecotourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areassome nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid virus however according to who  no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with peoples health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cellsthe covid is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals they are accountable for seventyfive percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe various governments and agencies top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes especially the clinical and medical waste likewise at the same time we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gearsin spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any postfinancial crisis a similar case was observed during the  financial crash  although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of  was observed but as the economy recovered in  emissions were at an alltime high after all only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic

has not yet halted and we are facing the nth wave of the coronavirus outbreak across several countries most notably the us india and brazil it is a fact that data analytics and ai are the big guns of our artillery in this fight against the covid pandemic it has helped us in several stages of this outbreak like the detection of its first outbreak vaccine development and manufacturing contact tracing and future hotspot detection some of these interesting applications are discussed in this articlea lesserknown fact is that the covid outbreak was first detected in toronto canada nearly  miles away from the first outbreak nine days before the who issued its warning it was with the help of big data analytics and ai more specifically deep learnings dl a subset of machine learning application in natural language processing nlp to analyze text inputs that traced the surge of pneumonia cases in the wuhan province of china the specialty of dl algorithms is that they mimic the brain cells called neurons and can identify patterns in big data this dlbacked software is used as inputs reports from public health organizations global airline ticketing data etc these were used to flag unusual surges and potential spreads of infectious diseasesthe next application of big data analytics and ai was in the research and development of drugs to halt covid ai was used to analyze the protein structure of the virus findings that were significant in the progress of vaccine development in preliminary studies it was found that it does not mutate as fast as other viruses such as hiv which means that a prophylactic vaccine is a better way to proceed rather than a therapy but there is also some evidence supporting the fact that when we find any kind of cure for it there is a chance of the virus mutating which is what happened and major mutations have been found in the uk brazil and south africa ai also assisted scientists in rapidly shortlisting a set of already available vaccines that could be effective against the coronavirusanother interesting application of ai can be found in the selection of the right candidates ie most likely to test positive for testing coronavirus in case of insufficient testing resources this method was first exercised on greek borders and was called project eva whenever a traveler wanted to come into greece he had to fill out a form known as passenger locator form plf at least  hours prior to arrival containing information on their origin country demographics point and date of entry and the intended destination eva then allocated testing resources according to the size of the set of passengers to be tested after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine the results were sent back to the program for realtime learningthe question remains how eva made allocations it was found that statistically only the origin country and the city were significant factors for screening ultimately from a variety of countries and city pairs eva had to predict how many testing resources were to be allocated at each entry point and to particular passengers from a location is technically called the multiarmed bandit mab problem and the chosen method to solve this problem was an ai algorithm called optimistic gittins index this algorithm identified on average x as many asymptomatic infected travelers as random surveillance testing and up to x as many during peak travel after the test results if found positive they are put in quarantine following the collection of significant data through the aforementioned process after a certain period policies were made categorizing them separately and imposing restrictions on travelers from the specific location this eva as presented above was in operation from august th to november st processing around  plfs each day and testing on an average  of households entering the country every dayabove mentioned applications just show the tip of the iceberg and there is more to get into some of the other developments to watch for include the use of image recognition to identify covid based on xray images the use of deep learning to predict the d

is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these daysbuzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people ai ml stats data mining and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing but this is not true at allthe only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into informationin academics while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference thus becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners hence this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitionsthen what is the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data miningthe essential difference between these disciplines lies in their aims and the approach taken to achieve those aimsthe aims of each of these fieldsare explained in detail in the following sectionsartificial intelligencethe aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities then to satisfy this aim we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror yes humans are the best examples of intelligent entities thus in the s researchers began exploring the thought process the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research after setting this goal studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve humanlevel performance in all cognitive tasks sufficient to fool an interrogator but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain intelligence has no meaning thus mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it build it the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain so basically this initial aim was humancentered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agentconcurrently the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace with the advances in computer science the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated as programs were being applied to solve reallife problems it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans one of the best examples of this could be the chessplaying program an ai program defeated the worlds best chess player garry kasparov this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program this leads to a question is human intelligence the ideal intelligenceas computers became more advanced they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks that is why the new definition of intelligence was being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems so rather than considering the nature of agents researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem the problemsolving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers thus some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer so a computer and problemsolving approach were adopted so the humancentered approach and computer problemsolving approach are the two main aims of ai both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insightsboth the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of aimachine learningin the problemsolving approach there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim consider the example of solving a math problem there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problemsolving approach let us say two math problems are given for you to solve the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is notconsider the first problem the first problem is familiar to you that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past so there comes a question how our mind is able to solve that problem the answer is that you have solved similar problems in the past thus you have learned from the past data how to solve such problems thus even if you havent seen that problem in the past you will still be able to solve similar problems this is one form of intelligenceconsider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past then to solve this problem you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process this is the second kind of intelligencefor ai to build intelligent agents both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent but the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own that is the second type of intelligenceso the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning so the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai so this is the main difference between ai and mltechnically speaking it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions patterns without being explicitly programmed this statement needs some elaboration the essence of ml is related to the process of generalization and learning from past data generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims consider how we humans recognize daily life objects if we see an animal then we can easily recognize if it is a dog or a cat it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it the answer is generalizationif you were given a picture of a dog you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog because our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a concept of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog so the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our mindswith generalization only can come real information so we try to give computers the ability to generalize the raw data and convert it into information which can be patterns and trends in the data on their ownstatisticsthis is the discipline that concerns the collection organization analysis interpretation and presentation of data statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it so it is the study of explaining the data itself statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statisticsdescriptive statistics deals with the explanation or description of data thus the name descriptive statistics it tries to explain as much information as possible easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwiseinferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives consider a simple case of cooking a soup after completing the recipe you will taste a small sample that is a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad depending upon the result of the sample you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole good or bad similarly in statistics there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information for example consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very timeconsuming and costly in these cases applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty that is where inferential statistics come for helpsothe use of data in the context of uncertainty and decisionmaking in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with so however and whatever the data statistics tries to explain that data this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml but statistics help these fields to correctly interpret the datadata mining data is not useful at all in its raw form consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature pressure etc the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form then processed analyzed to gather valuable insights which can be used to solve a problemdue to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets to gather insights data mining is also referred to as knowledge discovery that is why carly fiorina former ceo of hewlettpackard once said the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight this statement completely explains the aim of data mining so the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims but the approaches taken in all of these fields help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields this is the beauty of these fieldsblackcoffer insights  abhishek govekar vishwakarma institute of technology pune india', 'data science is gaining popularity exponentially over the past decade and thanks

consultation rather they might feel that they need to have a direct talk with the doctor which can boost up their confidence and also it helps to maintain a better relationship with the doctor and patient the patients feel trust when they talk to doctors face to face moreover doctors also might be able to console their patients when they have direct interaction with their patients there could also be patients who doubt if these virtual methodologies are really trusted worthy or not it is so because while the patients have direct contact with their patients the qualifications are visible to

animal testing tissues and cells from brain liver kidney etc is taken from an animal and kept in a suitable growth medium for a few weeks or even for a year these cultures can be used to test the

concept would be an awareness in beings of their surroundings themselves and their own perception the reason this part of our mind remains unascertained is that consciousness isnt observable unlike brain matter that is studied scientifically the physical clarification of awareness is in a general sense incomplete it doesnt include what it feels to be the subject for the subject there likewise is by all accounts an unbridgeable illustrative gap between the physical world and our consciousness as suggested by an incident of eastern and shamir traditions consciousness is both universal and primal whilst we have made tremendous progress in understanding brain activity over the years this research hasnt been able to answer all the questions relating to the nature of emotions and experienceshistorybeginning within the late nineteenth century this was a time that once had psychological queries driven by a philosophical understanding of the mind which was typically equated with consciousness as a result the analysis of brain and behavior naturally thought of the role of consciousness in behavioral management by the brainthe ancient mayans were among the first to propose a sorted out feeling of each degree of consciousness its purpose and its worldly association with mankind since consciousness incorporates stimuli from nature as well as interior stimuli the mayans trusted it to be the most essential type of existence equipped for evolution the incas however thought about consciousness as a movement of mindfulness as well as of worry for others toojohn locke an early philosopher said that consciousness and so individuality are freelanced of all substances he also detected that there is no reason to believe that consciousness is stuck to any specific body or mind or that consciousness cannot be transferred from one body or mind to a different one karl marx another early thinker denies the mindbody classification and holds that consciousness is jeopardized by the material eventualities of ones settings william james an american psychologist differentiated consciousness to a stream  unbroken and continuous despite several changes and shiftswhile the main center of a lot of the analysis moved to strictly note cable behaviors throughout the primary half of the twentieth century analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the sin sigmund freuds psychoanalytic theory we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness preconscious conscious and unconscious were responsible for ones behavior and thinking he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts the id the ego and the superego the id is present at birth instinctual and operates according to the pleasure principle the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy finally the superego is an internalization of societys moral standards and responsible for guilt now the id is regarded as unconscious whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches however and didnt conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized leaving the questions unansweredsigmund freuds theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people sigmund freuds work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth character memory sexuality and therapy however his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments sigmund freud didnt provide any evidence to support his claimsbraintoday the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally issues of interest include phenomena such as perception blindsight brainwaves during sleep and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugsa greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters however to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain that is they should search for the neural connections of consciousnesshope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain or a particular pattern of global brain activity will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness a few brain imaging strategies for example eeg and mri scans have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinationsa few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isnt adequate to create consciousness it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event when areas for example the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging particularly the prefrontal cortex which is involved in a range of high order functionsone mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness analysts can record mind waves or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum using an electroencephalograph eeg and placing electrodes on the scalp the four types of brain waves alpha beta theta and delta each correspond with one mental state relaxed alert lightly asleep and deeply asleepmemoryepisodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past the hippocampus located in the brains temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memoryconsciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious offurthermore several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness working memory operatesmaintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasksthe current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects including spatial resolution temporal resolution or scope examples of such methods are pet fmri eeg implanted electrodes etcpet and fmri have temporal resolution problems eeg is wellknown to have localizability difficulties and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons that is they are restricted in scope hence huge numbers of our speculations while testable on

communicate with them experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems for example agnosia a failure to decipher visual data alzheimers disease and autism however we actually dont comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an objectseveral different disorders of consciousness include lockedin syndrome minimally conscious state persistent vegetative state chronic coma and brain deathlockedin syndrome otherwise called pseudo coma is a condition wherein a patient is aware however cant move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movementsin a minimally conscious state the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness patients need to give restricted however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance this could be following straightforward orders comprehensible speech or purposeful conductin a persistent vegetative state the patient has sleepwake cycles but lacks awareness is not able to communicate and only displays reflexive and nonpurposeful behavior the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourselike coma chronic coma results generally from cortical or whitematter harm after neuronal or axonal injury or from central brainstem sores usually the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to  of the normal range the patient lies with eyes shut and doesnt know about self or environmental factorsbrain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity and function including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness sleepwake cycles or behavior and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep statefuture predictions and conclusionas we can see from the history of scholars endeavors to study consciousness empirically its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods in the past psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics in the battle between realists and illusionists taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesnt allow for concrete evidenceas we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus similarly even though consciousness plays a major role in memory we currently lack the facilities to research it fully in the future there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities however which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehandas it seems researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are

become an obvious activity among the human raise now with the inclusion of startups like space x once dreamed for reaching out at space now is coming true we all have to agree upon a fact that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a muchneeded area for our survivalwith time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing forall this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late s this idea didnt stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression space exploration was not a new normal companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for but things change with the entry of paypals owner elon musk in  where he laid stones of space x with nasa providing the launchpad for their explorationbeing space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing here one has to realize the optimum but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology thus this unimaginable quest for the search of space was farfetched thoughnow being in  we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too proper planning analysing organising and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by  and would able to colonize by  for achieving these vision they have planned a total of  times prelaunch of the same rocket which they will be launching by  not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of   billion yearly by  already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer spacebut the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about  trillian which is more than many countries gdp placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heightsalso our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish because in the end we do not satisfy what we have achieved we are only looking for other things and crave to achieve thatin order to achieve that planning is most crucial stage as of now we have searched  planets but still didnt shortlisted the outcomes but according to the decade theory of elon musk it seems to be possibleas the most important thing to survive is the atmospheric environment whether is this suitable or not and in order to make it suitable what steps had to take and maintain the suitable level of oxygen the missions are now what everyone is focusing about finding the source of water because its nd crucial thing which is needed to surviveapart from the excitement and the things the threats or the uncertainties are bound to happen like any kind of mammal which could occur during construction or after that so the security for that or any protection so that uncertainties could be replicatedafter the basic things other factors like what are the natural habitats available there whether the plants could be grown over there or not if yes then what types of plants could survive therethe environment for the animals is safe or not because to balance the nature we need all types of animals natural habitat even insects and other small things which seems to be ignorable but plays an important role in maintaining the environmental balance for eg  ants are among the leading predators of other insects helping to keep pest populations low ants move approximately the same amount of soil as earthworms loosening the soil in the process and increasing air and water movement into the ground they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matterso every small thing contributes in its own wayanother matter of concern is the level of artificial intelligence and machine learning required to maintain that kind of requirement because as the current scenario we need energy to run any vehicle or even for the robotics so the availability of the energy and the source of energy is neededand apart from this the heat of sun is equally important in order to maintain the level because with artificial air we can survive but not for so long so in order to remain healthy as well the calculation has to be done when thinking about disease you may have heard in the news about the concern that antibiotics such as penicillin  which help fight infections  may eventually stop working global health organisations are trying to reduce the use of antibiotics especially for conditions that arent serious this is because their overuse in recent years means that theyre becoming less effectivebut still we can survive without antibiotics because there are waysof dealing with diseases caused by bacteria such as isolation which is how they were treated before penicillinit might sound like something set firmly in the realm of fantasy but experts in private industry and governments around the world are trying to understand how feasible it would be to establish a lunar base some scientists think humans could survive comfortably on the moon in some ways the very minimal gravity of the moon might actually be more conducive to life than the microgravity astronauts experience on the international space stationalthough it hasnt been formally tested some experts hypothesize that the small amount of gravitational force put on an astronauts body when on the mooncould help stem some of the adverse effects like bonedensity and muscle loss that space flyers experience while living in microgravity on the international space stationby using the moons indigenous material space agencies can save money on the cost of flying pricey missions to and from the moons surfaceonce on the moon instead of having to stage costly missions aimed at delivering oxygen and other necessary resources from earth experts might be able to actually use the material to manufacture gasses needed to sustain life on the satelliteon earth we are protected from radioactive solar winds and cosmic rays by our own magnet field known as the magnetosphere but out in the space we cant rely on this type of protection and in order to make that protection it could take a lot but yes with more upgraded technology it could achievealthough till now the approximate value of the project is  trillion but the aim is to make the fare equivalent to the normal air fareas once we are comfortable with all the resources securities for uncertainties risk analysis and the probability of survival of the human being and many other factors after consideration then development wont take much timebecause to construct a building it take normally  months which is totally acceptablebut the main concern is the density of the land ie whether the land has the capacity to bear that much weight or not and the type of land is adaptable for cultivation or nor although land can be converted into different types of cultivation but with the help of upgraded technologyin order to transport the equipments on the regular basis a large amount of fuel is required and other factors as well and built the propellor depo for rocket landing building various infrastructure for the city one by one will create a way forward for idea of

popularity has increased because of the stories he tells for every art he is selling his customer immediately loved him for this while buying a bonsai art he loved to sell his customer with his artwork and a story related to that product which resurrects his presence through his art in customers soon enough his business thrived and nowadays he is always busy after the digital revolution although his sales increased he was not happy he was not satisfied something is eating up his mind day by day he could not understand whats the reason behind his remorsea chatbot is an awesome invention of the digital revolution it is the reallife embodiment of customer engagement every business needs this feature will be an understatement because customer engagement is the base of any business the chatbot does the exact thing digitally it helps customers to answer the queries and tell about the product that the business has to offer is a fully automated way with vibrant customizations mr sakamoto is running his business for the last fifteen years now and now he is happy that he was not for the past couple of years the rationale behind his happiness is the chatbot though he has a website and app to sell his bonsai art he could not engage with the customers in the way he wanted to he has trained his employees and apprentices but they are not providing the same service in the way he does he was unsatisfied and the chatbot relives him from his sadness he has done all that at affordable prices in no timelets understand the mr sakamotos mondai nai perspective about why chatbot is the answer of his problemsbuilding the trust with customersthis is the fundamental and root cause for which mr sakamoto has to implement the chatbot in the first place his stories are embedded with each art the product which he sells needs this story to be with it his stories which were not been told to all the customers before are now sharing with this chatbot and building the

is small medium or largetarget the millennial customermillennials a word that was not introduced before  the generation which is stuck in between genx and geny a generation of people accustomed to both digitization and old culture they are the most targeted audience in this era what else would be more approachable to this generation than a chatbot its easy less time consuming to use mr sakamoto is now one of the few genx persons who can do business with the millennial so easilybetter human interactionsmr sakamoto has some employees and apprentices he has trained them as per his needs but there is a limit they cant deliver the exact things that he can or the way he does neither chatbot can do that exactly it will accurately follow the instructions not only the chatbot solve the queries of the customer in his way but also give a recommendation to the product in the way he wants too is there any more attribute he would care about that absolutely no servicethe most expensive thing for any businessman is the return of their customer with an empty hand because of his unavailability a chatbot is a perfect way to solve it for mr sakamotos customized chatbot is not only present for customers in their availability but also it was giving the response to the customer in all the time zone all over the world mr sakamoto wouldnt be happier for this featurescaling up business in

guardiola and jose mourinho i know it might look a lame question especially to the ardent football followers at first instinct the answer is that they are regarded as the top managers in the football universe uclwinners but when given a closer look these managers werent that great when it came to their careers as football players any nave observer can build a fallacy of causation and correlation that those who dont have a great career as a football player will go on to become a great football manager but is this restricted just to football mike brearley one of the greatest captains in the history of cricket and the author of the book the art of captaincy wasnt the prolific batsman of his time our former president a p j abdul kalam didnt have a political background but was still appointed as the president of our country and went to become one of the finest presidents our country has ever had so can it be stated with confidence that great leaders need not be the expert in their respective fieldslets understand the leadership role types of leaders and explore a few more perspectives before we arrive at a conclusionlets start by first understanding what or who is a leader a leader is not a position or a designation its a virtue if employed correctly from a janitor to the ceo from a student to a researcher from a content writer to a philosopher everybody is a leader leadersareeverywhere so what are the virtues of a leader one of the famous personality trait theories the big  personality trait theory is always linked closely with leadership as per the various researches the personality traits of extraversion openness and conscientiousness are associated with leaders more often than the other two traits not just these humble and empathetic are also considered as the adjectives that are frequently associated with leaders but nowhere is technical expertise related to a leader notsotechnicalas stated by colin powell leadership is the art of accomplishing more than the science of management says is possible itsart if leadership is an art and leaders are the artists then more or less the leaders can be viewed as directors of the films who are organizing arranging managing and directing the scenes another analogy for that can be the orchestra where the conductor is using the batonstick to set the rhythm of the band so is it necessary for the conductor to himself or herself by a great violinist no when it comes to the corporate sector the leader need not be an expert on the technology but should know how the technology functions so that heshe can utilize it in the best possible way they can allocate the task of building technology to the right technical experts and how do the leaders identify the right person for that job or how do leaders know what qualities to look for in a person experience every great leader once started off as one of the frontline workers or at the bottom of the pyramid in the hierarchical structure even though they might not have had the technical expertise in their respective fields their visionary outlook their management skills and the experience they gathered helped them in achieving their targets leaders can always take the assistance of the subject matter experts to guide them in situations of technical difficulties as per the great man situational and trait theory of leadership leadership is innate to the person leadership though can be conditioned or can be brought out in a person by rewarding him great leaders show unconditional attachment towards their vision everyone knows how to read a map but which path to choose isnt something that can be taught leaders give the direction or vision to the company and drive it closer to the target that the company wants to achieve leadership theories dont focus on the technical knowledge of the leaders but rather more on people skills their approach towards a problem and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katzthough it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas but these leaders are generally at the middle management level as per the different leadership styles a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the peoplefirst mindset a collaborative approach towards solving the problem these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the employees at the bottommost level since the managers at the top of the pyramid dont get much time to invest in people they appoint the right people on their behalf to get the job done consider an it firm so as per the points mentioned above does it mean that a leader or the manager shouldnt know how to code depends if the person is the first line manager then he or she should probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the projects kpis the project manager who might be an operations manager mba from an it background probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the clients perspective the ceo might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the codebut in todays competitive world leaders cant be one dimensional they need to have expertise in multiple areas to be at the top mike brearley if got a chance to play a t match wont even get picked into aside not because of his age but because of his not so great looking batting statisticsthegamehaschanged his leadership skills wont be enough to get him into the squad but he can be a great leader if selected to coach the top  captains in the world today as we have already discussed the film directors their job isnt to teach the cameramen on how to set up or operate lens settings etc the camera their job is to guide the cameramen on what angle it should be held and how he or she should coordinate with the lights crew so that a perfect shot is captured so even if a leader may not be a technical expert of his field but if he or she has the right approach and mindset understands the system and its process then he or she can hire the best talent for the job and can get the work done by guiding the talent with his or her visionso the answer to the question which we came across in the first paragraph is yes and no depending upon the position in the hierarchy yes for a frontline manager and no for a cxo and the type of the leader you are the level of technical expertise needed varies though as stated earlier by robert katz the cxos need to have the least amount of technical expertise the cxo should know how the technology functions or what are the applications what processes are to be followed to build the technology he or she should now what is to be done rather than how it is to be done itsnothowitswhat otherwise even though the company might be sitting on a gold mine but if the leader isnt aware of that or isnt learned enough to know what to do with it no company can succeed even with having all the resources at their disposal leaders command respect and dont demand it and thats possible when they give value to their frontline employees seek timely advice from the technical experts and put the resources to the best of its uses otherwise you will be surrounded by technical experts like dilberts dilbertblackcoffer insights  rohan mehta

hisher companys strategy to beat the competition leaders help themselves and others to do the right things they set direction build an inspiring vision and create something new leadership is about mapping out where you need to go to win as a team or an organization and it is dynamic exciting and inspiringin my point of view we cannot become a good leader without technical expertise because every task in the organization its required a lot of skills knowledge consistent enthusiastic patience motivating inspiring industrious and critical thinking on the basis of the field we are doing a leader should have the ability to motivate self and others effective oral and written communication critical thinking skills at the working team and delegating a task good leaders do have these abilities and if we wanted to create a future leader they need to take in a large volume of information and to take the essential elements that define the core problem to solve they need to organize a team to solve these problems and to communicate to a group they need to established trust with a group and use the trust to allow the team to accomplish the work more than it could be done alone though all these skills we have but its would not sufficient to make us a great leader because to excel and utilize these abilities in practice we need a lot of technical expertise in a particular domain for example like in a hospital if the head of the hospital is lead by other people rather than doctor then the hospital would become worse at a point because the person from other fields he could not lead and understand the real scenario and mechanism that the hospital is functioning and he would not understand the staff and the patient as well hence to lead the hospital doctor is deserved who knows his own field how to lead and understand the real scenario of it thats why being a leader requires technical expertise to have great knowledge and understanding about his own organization every person if they want to become a leader they should have technical expertise on their own organization so that their organization would run smoothly hence nobody could run other organization if we do not have the technical expertise on that fieldso be a leader not a boss which makes your life much better as theyre a saying that  a good objective of leadership is to help those who are doing poorly to do well and to help those who are doing well to do even betterblackcoffer insights  caldinus nongrang nit meghalaya', 'when we talk about ai different people have different

other factors in a sense all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mindin the future development of ai programs it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment nearly  kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the

many times the certain question comes to the mind when we think about what we deem perfect but how do we verify itlet us understand this through the work of three individuals who know are to be put on a task in carpentry on a budget all are given rs  assumed to complete this task they cant go beyond this budgetmanish vinay and sameer need to make a stool for themselves each manish has no understanding of carpentry he learns from youtube vinay took his carpentry lessons during engineering so he has a practical idea of how to make a stool but sameer is a carpenter so he has a total understanding of the material process and final productlet us start with manish understand that the task is to get their jobs done manish has two options here he can either order parts and assemble it himself or order the material required such as wood glue nails etc and then work on it before the assembly of the final product the only difference is his lack of expertise in this fieldvinay has the same options but has practical experience from his carpentry classes during the workshop in engineering sameer has an advantage since he has both skill and experience perfected over a course of timeall three are given three days for the task since manish finds it easy to assemble the stool using parts procured from another carpenter he talks to a carpenter he knows and orders  leg parts  horizontal support bars and one circular base which will sit on the top vinay thinks he will be able to shape the parts because of his experience as a student and orders several cylindrical wooden leg parts cuboidal bars and a thick sheet sameer has all the required material in his shop and he begins to work on the stool on the first daymanish and vinay wait for a day for the parts to come they begin to work on the second day manish uses the tricks learned from youtube videos uses a hammer to place the nails purchased from a nearby shop in the premade hole applies glue in certain areas as directed in the video and places weight on the assembled stool he waits for the glue to curevinay uses borrowed drill bits drill machines cutters sandpapers purchased from a shop etc and starts working on the wooden parts as soon as the parts arrive in the morning he is able to recall his carpentry instructions and attempts to shape the parts based on drawing of his product he made last night sameer meanwhile has completed his assembly and has put the assembly to rest for the glue to cureon the third day each of them has the stool ready they evaluate their own work and notice certain factsmanish notices that he did complete the task but his stool was wobbly and not glued well it could fall the moment he sits on it also he forgets to polish the wooden parts and give it a professional finish since he forgot to watch that bit of video over youtubevinay completes the task his stool is sturdy and cured well overnight but there are minor issues with it one of the three legs is cut short by a few mm and the stool a tad unstablesameer on the other hand completes the task with a good product the stool is wellbalanced and polished as he expected from him sameer is satisfied with his work and finds it to stool perfect manish thinks he did his best considering he had no experience of the task to be done he is satisfied with his work but vinay is unhappy he could have done better and made the product better he doesnt find his efforts well put and thinks he wasnt productive enough and hence his stool is nowhere perfectunderstand that all of them had a set of skills and experience but only sameer had the right skills and experience to produce a perfect product manish and sameer were satisfied and happy with their work manish made a wobbly stool which could break the moment someone sat on it but happy he gave the task a go he thinks put the efforts and he did a good job it was only vinay who could not overcome the fact that his work was not perfectin vinays case it can be observed that he could not deliver what he learned from carpentry classes the reason is simple he put effort but didnt have the experience experience mattered since vinay thinks otherwise he believes he has the perfect skills to complete the task but he could not deliver the results he is not satisfied with his results and wishes to spend another day working on the stool on his own to get to his idea of the perfect resultin this case the idea of perfection itself is misplaced you see the end product made by vinay and manish would not match sameers but the task could have been completed had they understood where their shortcomings lied for both it was their skill sameer had the perfect skill to get the expected result which resulted in better productivity others didntand in this story every individual put effort regardless of the result but some were satisfied and some dissatisfied their satisfaction made their creations perfect in their eyes and dissatisfaction made one believe he wasnt productive enough perfection is subjective and productivity is utility extracted given a certain amount of effortyou can try to be as productive to achieve something but ultimately its the satisfaction you get that defines the boundary of perfection if you arent satisfied you wont find anything perfect you would just waste both your time and effort over something that doesnt suit you in the first place as explained in the story beforeit isnt productivity that will be the greatest enemy but your satisfactionsatisfaction will determine how you perceive perfection and defines where your threshold for perfection lies the real enemy is dissatisfaction you get demotivated and restless you lose sight and discontinue only because you are unable to pass your own expectation so its the only obstacle that comes in between productivity from time to timeproductivity is far from being your enemy the greatest enemy will be your expectations which lead to dissatisfaction it will play a major role in crafting your idea of perfection in every dayblackcoffer insights  jude francis institute of management technology imt nagpur', 'brief the financial crisis of  started as a crisis in the subprime mortgage market ie in a market where lending of loans is done to people who may have difficulty in maintaining the repayment schedule or in simple terms loans were given out to people without proper checks and low credit scores which ultimately led onto a huge global collapsethe financial crisis of  or great recession is considered the worst economic crisis since the great depressionfinancial crisis explained in the year  there was a dotcom boom or otherwise known as the dot com bubble in the united states a period of massive growth in the use of the internet because of which the stock market prices started increasing rapidly however around the year  it dropped which led people and investors to withdraw their investments from the stock market rapidly it led to the decline of the price of shares in stock markets and the interest rate plummeted to around  very quickly in a short spaninvestors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets fig  rise and fall of the dot com bubbleas interest rates went lower and lower real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in ie in real estateduring that same time investment banks saw an opportunity chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo collateralized debt obligations and started providing it to these investors after getting a credit rating of aaa very safe investment from the credit rating agencies investors naturally fell for it and started buying these cdosso now the risk factor of these loans got transferred from the banks to the investment banks and then again to the cdo investorswith the high buying demand of cdos investment banks started demanding or pressurizing banks to provide even more loans so that they can provide more cdos to the investors however banks had already provided loans to people with good credit history and regular income people but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with low credit scoresapproximately bn worth of loans were given out during the period  and most of them were clubbed as cdos with a aaa rating from the credit rating agencies approximately  of these cdos were marked with a aaa ratinginvestment banks and credit rating agencies were now enjoying large profits during this time moodys a credit rating agency profits increased x times during that period looking at the huge profits being made by the investment banks and credit rating agencies insurance companies like aig now started giving out insurance on these cdos to the investors and they called it cds credit default swap aig believed that since the cdos were rated as aaa very safe investment the failure chances of these cdos were very minimal they misjudged or were unaware of the fact that some of the loans that were clubbed under these cdos were sub prime loansnow cdo investors started buying out cds from aig and other companies to safeguard and protect them from any losses aig then started making huge profits because of the premiums that the investors had to pay but they never realized the outcome if by any chance the cdos fail at some point in time thus the risk factor again got transferred from the cdo investors to the insurance companiesfig  flow diagram showing how the risk factors got transferredcoming to the loan borrowers now sub prime borrowers from banks were unaware of the fact of adjustable rate loans interest rate of these loans keeps changing and thus had to pay lower interests at the start but more interest rates later onthe borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around  and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans almost  of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loanthis led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back with the highinterest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting because the price of their houseshomes fell below the loan amount that they had taken earlier banks stopped receiving money and also because of this chain reaction the value of cdos ultimately came down to some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt ex  lehman brothers moreover insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance as a result some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt aig too almost lost about bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos however the us govt finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankruptcdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led to credit crunch became very difficult to get loans and the whole economy of the us underwent a crisis that led to a global impact all around the world unemployment increased manifold and many new businesses had to shut down global trades all around the world also saw a crisis and finally global recession hit the worldcauses of the crisis improper screening of loan borrowers resulting in subprime loan borrowers which included even borrowers with no stable

this definition changes as per different cultural norms in a much broader term our society is also not aware of the concept of binary and nonbinary gender which includes queer trans and intersex individuals as well the socially acceptable thing is to have gender expressions as per our gender identity so when it comes to choosing their career people tend to choose a job role that gives them higher social belongingness eg we see more womenas compared to men in nursing careers as it requires more feminine qualitiesthere are different versions of this perception which we can see either in the societyin terms of socially assigned gender roles or in the workplacein the form of gender discrimination stereotypical thinking sexism etc eg as per their assigned roles in society women are most likely to take care of their family and children and this affects their income and career growth the motherhood penalty is a term defined by sociologists which states about the inverse correlation between income level and the number of children ie there is also an income difference between a mother and a nonmother employee as per oecd data there is a  reduction in wages for women per childlack of economic opportunities even in the tech industry women are paid less than men as per ilo data on average women are paid  less than men worldwideeven when it comes to promotion men are preferred more it is to be noted that the numbers are even worse when there is intersectionality involved eg a transgender woman will be paid less than a white woman and so on as per the national centre for

permission and immediately faced police harassment after a few weeks the government eased restrictions and essential vendors werebeing permitted to venddue in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks however the cost of doing business as well as the risk has gone up significantly with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city also with the lockdown still partially in place the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings due to the harsh summer heat perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do havethe state has recently announced astimulus package of inr  crore for nearly  lakh vendors acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr  for all vendors but this is not sufficient instead of credit the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit a cash grant as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly the vendors need income support to be able to restart work and if they are not able to do so how will they return the loan in the face of the everchanging crisis vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods to this end vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agendalivelihood promotion for all vendors including those selling nonessential goods the impact of covid has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streetsreopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets for fresh food cooked food and essential household items and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same going forward vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities running water washing stations and toilets the authorities should work with town vending committees tvcs for the sameprovide direct support which is delinked from existing registration requirements as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work the government stimulus package while a welcome step is insufficient in the nature of relief credit not direct cash transfer and eligibility only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country in addition government relief and support needs to be delinked from very rigid registration requirements as very few vendors have been registered in india in delhi out of roughly  street vendors only about  have some form of occupational identification if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state then the government should also accept registration with a workers organisationunion as a proxy for governmentissued vending passesensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soapsanitisers for street vendors at their place of work additionally vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors especially cooked food vendors in ways to maintain hygiene while workingtaking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits as mentioned earlier the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi before the crisis and subsequent lockdown the town vending committees tvcs were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors as we get used to the new normal the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisisblackcoffer insights  parth goyal iet davv', 'the covid pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory with growing worried about how the pandemics catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets interruptions to specific aspects of it such as the availability of fresh vegetables could have a negative influence on population health which has already been noted as a source of worrydespite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains warehouse clubs and supercenters in grocery retail vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings fresh vegetable vendors are typically smaller and more communityoriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores greengrocers storefront stands street carts and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city nyc particularly in ethnic enclaves despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailerssince the covid pandemic began many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states including new york city have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities furthermore these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low pricesthese fresh vegetable vendors unlike larger wellestablished grocery store vendors may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid epidemic consequently the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendorsin order to assess the impact of the covid pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors surveillance data from both before and after the pandemics inception is requiredafter a few days vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police after a few weeks the government relaxed the limitations allowing vital traders to sell their wares due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks however the cost of doing business has increased dramatically as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to cityimposed travel limitations furthermore with the partial lockdown still in place the number of buyers has decreased as have earnings perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do haveconsider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid  the state has launched an inr  crore stimulus package for over  lakh vendors realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr  but this will not be enough instead of credit the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit such as a cash grant to help people start earning money on a regular basis the vendors require income support in order to resume work and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the everchanging crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agendapromotion of vendors livelihoods particularly those selling nonessential goods covid has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streetsmarket reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets including weekly markets for fresh food cooked meals and necessary household items and daily markets on the sides of highways these markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation and the government should issue recommendations in this regard in the future vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind as well as adequate sanitary facilities running water washing stations and toilets for this the government should collaborate with town vending committees tvcsprovide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements when the lockdown is lifted and vending starts vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work while the government stimulus plan is a positive step it falls short in terms of assistance credit rather than direct cash transfer and eligibility only registered vendors are eligible which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country furthermore government assistance and support must be divorced from the countrys strict registration requirements as only a few vendors have been registered in india only about  of delhis  street sellers have any type of employment identity if the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance the government should accept registration with a workers organizationunion as a surrogate for governmentissued vending passesproviding flowing water and soapsanitizers to street sellers at their place of business the government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soapsanitizers at their place of business additionally vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors particularly those selling prepared foods on how to maintain hygiene while on the jobtaking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance as previously stated the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in delhi the town vending committees tvcs were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout as we adjust to the new normal the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult timefinally some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic only to reopen recently alternatively vendors may have launched soon after the inperson checks were completed but still within the junejuly  endpoint timeframe this is a drawback of the method in order to offer the most reliable covid pandemic monitoring data data must be collected in a short period of timeblackcoffer insights  priyanshu kumar mdi murshidabad', 'as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a usually a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries innate business models in this article we will look at the impact of covid pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply sidethe aviation and tourism industries has two major customers tourists and business travellers let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be likealmost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because offinancial hardship an exceptionally large part of the worlds working population has been affected financially because of the pandemic unemployment rates are soaring and the ones who do still have a job are facing paycuts furloughs and deferment of salariesrisk of contraction because the disease spreads via social contact it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularly sanitized and is not crowded inherently tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducing social distancing measures convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficultexpansion of alternatives ways to relax as most people adapt to workfromhome environments the burnout rate is declining people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax more and more people are going out for walks doing yoga and finding new hobbies due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they dont feel the urge to breakfree and move away for a holidaynow let us look at different types of holiday revellers tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists according to business insider in almost  million foreigntouristsvisitedindia spending over  billion during january to november period however because of the pandemic almost all this business has been lostdue to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel those who do dare to venture out perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factorspoor quality of health care in india in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countriesdensely populated regions around tourist destinations because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy the areas are often densely populated which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this factmoving our focus to domestic tourists we subdivide our population according to income levelsbelow poverty line these people dont travellower income families these people majorly only travel to religious places or to visit family thus they dont contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relatives placemiddle income families they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsectionupper middle income families they vacation regularly often flying to nearby holiday spots this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus financial hardships people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity being risk averse these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severelyhigh income families this sector is relatively insulated from the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they are assured of the sanitization and social distancingin order to attract well paying customers the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes thus they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancingbecause of covid pandemic businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls thus the movement of business personnel will be restricted there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sectormoving over to the supply side the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain because the industry is a leisure expense manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped because of the drop in demand it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again furthermore workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographieslet us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and aprilairbnbs in america the bookings vanished in midmarch property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected the sharing economy like uber lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services interior design onetime spend and property maintenance which are fixed coststhus because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist they have people who depend on the owners rental income which made the problem worsehosts usually decide cancellation policy but under extreme circumstances like this one the company decided to override all existing policies many of whom werent strict and gave full refund to the guests the company got  billion loan and has helped out the owners financially by paying  for cancelled bookings capping at khost they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid evictionthankfully there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans airdna states that the listing splitup for airbnb is  list single property  owners list  properties  hosts have  propertiessome state governments in america have banned shortterm rentals this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives couldve generated revenuesso what are hosts doing nowmany are discounting units and looking for longterm tenants  months many are planning to apply for a smallbusiness loan seek forbearance from banks find longterm tenants independently of airbnb and sell propertyreluctance of workers to comeback to work americaaccording to the wall street journal roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques however it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issuesthis complicates reopening because workers dont want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven and business can reopen however money in the consumers pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open about  million americans are now on unemployment benefits majorly from restaurant hospitality and retail industriescongress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really timeconsuming for payments to be calibrated to each workers lost wages their  federal payment corresponds to hours wage but  states follow hoursmost workers dont want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their familiesworkers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up without income support lowwage workers would likely seek out other jobs including side hustles and gig work which could expose them and their households to the virus thus according to the government it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economycoronavirus on planesstudies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk combined with that in long journeys passengers may take off masksthus the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planescurrently the airlines plan on using selfcleaning material longlasting disinfectant touchless lavatories uv light as a disinfectant antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces and cleaning between flightshowever even after these efforts only  of people are flying compared to last year same time as of th may aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus as the coronavirus pandemic spread the entire industry jolted to a halt they are one of the hardesthit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to precovid levels and margins have also reduced however in with a bleak future this industry is here to stay because people have to travel and eventually they will vacation as well coronavirus has become a survival of the fittest test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processesblackcoffer insights  ishita srivastava bits pilani', 'thecovid pandemichas caused the most significant disruption to theworldwide sporting calender sinceworld war ii across the world and to

pandemic has reshaped the fundamental fabric of our world initiating in china in late december  the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world infecting millions in its wake countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees india has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries restricting the movement of people goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost towndue to such stringent restrictions on movement the economy has received a fatal blow the virus arrived in india at a time when the country was already in strife dealing with a slowing gdp growth rate and an everincreasing fiscal deficit the lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state other countries have also faced a similar predicament particularly in the us and europe both being hotspots for virus transmissionhowever upon taking a closer look at the global economy there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the it domain these sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from thema path to victoryif we look at the evolving itites industry around the world the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common flexibility these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time they havent shied away from changing the rules of the game lets look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdownsocial medialockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes with nothing much to do of significance as a result social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period reportedly there has been close to a  rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook instagram and whatsapp in the hardesthit economies twitter has reported a  increase in its user base as compared to last year the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situationvideo consumption sites such as youtube instagram and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits its no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape be it rumors regarding the cure for covid  gossips or rap battles these platforms provide viewers with their muchneeded dose of distractions as they say ignorance is blissdatamining enterprisesthe lockdown has proven to be a miracle for datamining companies with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have widespread implementation of datamining has been seen recently with most countries opting for governmentregulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times moreover these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreakalthough noble such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what

however the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services with an increasing reliance on remote working the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be criticalthe cloud computing services such as amazon web services microsoft azure and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest

traditional shopping methodsott platformsonline streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment having only been in existence for the past couple of years they had already however established a name for themselves before the lockdowns sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases for a while now now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concernedthis has already become evident with zee india reporting a whopping  increase in subscriptions and a  increase in the time spent on their site within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself another such platform mubi reported a  rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms which is unlikely to change anytime soonvideoconferencing platformsthe idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet not just audio or text but video conferencing is the need today hence its understandable why

almost  of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model and other smaller firms have followed suit what it tells us is that were headed in a direction were unlikely to return from remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soonhowever a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriouslya duality unlike any otherthe lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other weve witnessed where on the one hand the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal the unorganized sector and the msmes micro small and medium enterprises seem to be at the crux of deaththe sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis as a result of the lockdown several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves not receiving significant support from the government these people have been initiating treks back to their villages what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways walking weeks to find shelter and food truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework one i reckon wont heal anytime soona train unlikely to haltthe covid  pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon the areas that weve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that weve discussed it seems to be a neverending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this

eyestrain because the cornea pupil and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches dizziness and in some cases nausea and vomiting interestingly there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of

to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain video games may be helpfulmusculoskeletal problemspersistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck furthermore a case report involving a nineyearold teenager

children in the united states spend  of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games furthermore children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than  hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games were  less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than  hours engaged in the same activityin a  study an association between video game activity and an increase of mostly junk food intake was reported specifically single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake regardless of appetite it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video gamesseizures epileptichealth concerns that video games may

services or information with increasing degrees of nuance leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results the interest in voice is only going to growbecause voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well if not better than traditional query options customer trust in them is growing of toyearoldstalk to automated voice systems at least once a dayvoice shoppingis expected to reach  billion by up

avoid being left behind people are after convenience and all types of informationwhen people use voice search they dont just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a tvpeople want all kinds of other information such as your store hours how to connect to support specialists and when youre having your next sale this is partly why some experts have predicted a totally different internet within the

want different types of information from voice systems they also can use it at many points in the customer journey for example about half of shoppers use voice to research products even near me searches results are mostly done by customerscustomers also use voice toadd items to shopping lists track packages make a purchase give a rating or review contact support reorder something these statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions voice is often just the starting pointasurveyshowed that once a consumer makes a local voice search their next most common action is to call the business  customers also are highly likely to visit company websites  show up at the companys location  and do more research into that business or additional businesses  and  respectively so in short while voice services can allow a customer to complete many steps without human interaction you shouldnt see it as a total substitute many people are going to take further steps after the initial search and they still will want to hear a human voice respond back once in a while they are going to have more questions and theyre willing to physically connect with you and what you offer dont drop the ball in other areas like making your site aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate having enough staff ready to chat listing an accurate contact number or keeping your store wellstocked voice search already is shifting the way customers engage with brands but theres still time for companies of any size to get involved with voice systems in ways that can benefit both the customer and the businesss bottom line the next step is to find voice search solutions however as with other technologies these are not necessarily one size fits all meaning its

world in the way one had hardly imagined the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be longlasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work the way we interact what work we will do how the work will be done and whatnot to just give an example in the middle of the first lockdown fmcg major hindustan unilever hul went ahead with its merger it took place online entirely yes it took place online who could have ever imagined the merger can take place onlinechange is inevitable but some changes are temporary and some are permanent the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent in fact these changes were due for a long time and were coming at a slow pace what the pandemic has done is it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change so what exactly the changes will be lets look at them one by onethe first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards the zoom jio meet google meet and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held this may be bad news for the employees who are older than  years they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchyless the older employees would have to work with the younger ones there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent there will be more egalitarianism in companies the corporates will think much more about office space rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight the impact would be more prudent in small and midsized businesses the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses but its not going to be easy for companies the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world there would be no surprise if a lot of startups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies also travel is going to be reduced so the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other waythe second change is going to be struck down on employees already many of the companies and startups are reducing the workforce it is expected that new normal offices would work with an  workforce of that of the current workforce automation is on the verge due to safety reasons the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased in the new normal techenabled world the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers managers the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but dont really drive the business in the designationless set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic they automatically become redundant for the first time the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs also when the workforce in the company would be less in the company the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary it is a winwin situation for both employees and companies employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this the assessment of employees might change too rather than going for an annual performance review the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office the other change might be in the services sector the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years it also opens the opportunity for something very new the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market according to mckinsey the sales for such products are multiplying rapidlythere are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies lets dig deep into this minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more well this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average but it would be hard to stay the same as this the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero the highquality products will gather the attention of the purchasers it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy though this time may take some time it will surely return on trackbut every trouble comes with an opportunity this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him but for that companies are required to follow plans formulate strategies to suit their needs and pay more attention to the innovation the companies must form plans for the five stages from here these stages are rs resolve resilience return reimagination and reformresolve in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself the tendency of the company should not be like that they will return only after everything becomes normal in most parts of the country permission is granted to the companies for their operations if they wait for normalcy then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcyresilience the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity addressing solvency and grow for sustainability all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent for example the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainabilityreturn in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent identify report and contain future flareups many industries will face this problem of returning staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multiscenario modeling exercise reverting to noncovid care will require extensive planning and market testingreimagine the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic a small virus and the whole economy at the toss the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days this should become a permanent feature cross organizational collaboration has become much easier this should stay in the long runreform the last phase is the reform in this phase the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them also the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers the confidence in their brands they must regain itthere are three ways to shift work talent and skills to where and when they are needed most thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recoversmake work portablein this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful thus retaining their confidence is the utmost priority the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers the organizations require to create virtual offices there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to precorvid state by breaking out of rigid job constraints the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in realtimeaccelerate automationthis was happening before the pandemic too but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour the perception that automation is a jobkiller is totally wrong and in fact it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis organizations can increase automation in call centers this will reduce the response timeshare employees in crossindustry exchangestemporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines restaurants hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logisticsto conclude the companies should understand lives come first but livelihood matters the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services but this is not the end the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to precorvid situations the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever the last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and servicesblackcoffer

concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes thus it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence the phrase out of sight out of mind has never been so apt than in todays time social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content its why we call it social mediasocial media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read click on and share your messagein practicality it is not about a oneoff communication but more about the construction of a longterm relationship with your target customers hence when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative

concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouthsvarious states have provided relief packages and support but in a country as populous as ours it has hardly been appropriately implemented delhi for instance recently announced a rupee  million stimulus package to nearly  rupees recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods the sellers intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs  but this is not enough instead of loans the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate incomegenerating activities on a regular basis sellers need income support to get back to work and if they cant they will never be able to repay the loan amount in an everchanging crisis organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that

firstly a key risk from the covid pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial

commitments that they have with generators with longterm power purchase agreements the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis

dynamic it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the marketclearing price which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response

governments being on healthcare and relief measures the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out it addedicra ratings group head and senior vice president

decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about

relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucialthe revenues for power generation companies having longterm power purchase

in buildings but barely any knowledge of how to use it we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse that of being in unprecedented times the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis if we look back we can see that this crisis was not avoidable there was a lot we could have done but because we underestimated it so much the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamitiesfirst lets look at this in a reflective mode what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse the propagation of fake news take india for example clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner the spread of accurate and timely information is a must if we had spread awareness earlier we could have controlled the number of cases better like new zealand and ireland have done secondly in a situation of crisis the first thing to spread is fake news it is imperative that the government social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly since there is no accurate and transparent information a lot of uncertainty exists in the society this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market which in turn leads to an economic slowdown past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employeesmoreover we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns curfews national emergencies and pandemics the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis in such situations they cant even afford basic amenities india witnessed a mass exodus recently with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel homethis is something that they can still include in their relief programsgovernment intervention is a must right now this can be done in two ways first is to create more employment opportunities governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency health water sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs secondly if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference having better avenues for cash transfers easier loans and more exchange will automatically help a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work however industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged for example it sector health food and agriculture etcmoreover governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand the internet even in the times of physical social distancing we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit communicate policy strategies and inform people businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing hygiene and steps to be followedall diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies however with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level toowe must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical wellbeing now in the past when economies took a hit due to the  recession or calamities the first thing to break was peoples selfesteem suicide rates amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thingi dont believe that every crisis is the same of course there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see even though these are different times there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy our mental peace and prevent the spread of the virus the past has a lot to offer if we ponder we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work maintaining employee morale is important and that social engagement is imperative

various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers telly and social media platforms on day to day basis but this is the storyline of the present what about the future are the

covid it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels hostels and shopping malls all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and indemand fields not only this but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production delivery and surveillance inculcating many more in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectureseven the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety agility and work to be a top priority the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine appsnew businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices startup culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the

impact on multiple generations in different ways the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry  with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scaleas we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as wellsam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time as our academics advanced the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers the situation turned grim when he wasnt able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a neverending backlog of games as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse he was struggling it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visageas sophomores we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep

of online gaming and gambling platforms during that phase the peer group gaming group gained more influence than parental controldays arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds since a large amount of money is involved in gambling a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gamblingthe practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year sam was by no means in anyones good books no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen he was abandoned we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth with mutual consensus we decided to go ahead with sam initially we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect unfortunately he wasnt able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out at present he plays poker on a professional level keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware ofearlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is indepth to date can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison sir newton sir tesla sir einstein and many more that were engrossed in their

covid outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe the first case was detected on th december  in china the world health organization who prepared the first diagnostic kit on th january as the global coronavirus or covid pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling its effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms according to the data produced by supply managements report on business show that pmi purchasing managers index has declined  in the month of february mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum transportation and textile industries although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily  of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than  believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid disruptions the effective shutdown of industrial activity ie china ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide imported goods invested by investors set a significant setbackseveral experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid virus the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model ie the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by  the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virushowever the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand clearly the contraction of the aggregate demandside generates an economic slowdown on the other hand restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers note that software or financial serviceproducing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the shortrun to mediumrun since those works could be easily carried out based on work from home anthem however reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india rbi to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock since the escalation of demand specifically for nontraded products without an adequate increase in production supply would only result in inflation in other words supplyside management must go hand in hand with demandside policies even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government however conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense at the same time exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near futurecorona virus has mainly affected raw material exportdriven countries with the covid virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders production and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories there has been a huge revenue impact long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid pandemic the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragilethe crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of  this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of exportbased industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to intersectoral backward and forward linkage effect however the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector in the present situation the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of nonregulatory authority and out of direct government control moreover lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be longlasting the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economiesblackcoffer insights  anusil das stxaviers university', 'covid  has bought the world to its knees with businesses being shut travel being banned schools and colleges being closed we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction though situations are improving now and the lockdowns are being lifted it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentallyweve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid  on the economy education mental health and every other possible aspect but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid  on office space and coworking industries well it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now but the covid period hasnt ended this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space the same will be the condition in coworking industries wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roofhowever these problems are quite obvious though people havent thought about them much but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters but it also extends to metal space or for that fact space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinionscoronavirus has left a big scratch in our country just the way a car needs repair after an accident our country will also need repair after the control of this virus but unlike a car our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any supportneedless to say the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salarypeople tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition the problem doesnt arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other but instead it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others and in todays world where people keep money at the top of their priority list comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their companysince there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better but however will bring huge losses in the long run the fact is employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their bosss eyesmoreover since there will be comparisons among the employees it might happen that the employee of the month ends up being hated by all other employees in the company another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they dont this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office in fact employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their bestsuch situations will definitely arise in companies and offices wherein employees will compete for attention and resources which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning and all this will happen because of only one thing lack of office mental space ie space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some timeanother kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the longlasting impact of covid  is the coworking industry and offices this is because there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure as well the rent will remain the same because of this employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used however the number of resources will be the same and so there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the sameif the above two situations happen to occur at the same time which they most likely will we will observe a scene of intracompany as well as intercompany competition also our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition which itself will be a result of limited mental spacecovid  will have severe impacts on the office mental space of companies and people peoples thoughts how they treat others along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyones lives moreover we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment however we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any costblackcoffer insights  archit khandelwal shishukunj international

are endless and thus we know humans can never be satisfied when we were busy and all the work and stressful lives we all wanted breaks we used t crib and cry about not getting time for family and friends not having time for selfthis coronavirus outbreak had taught each one of us that how important it is to be thankful for everything we have in our lives while sitting i just realize that how lucky we are that we do not have to go out amidst this crisis to work and earn bread how sorry im for each the daily wage workers who have no other way but to go outthe second lesson is that we all

zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments the same is the case for resorts hostels motels etc that provide accommodations since there are no occupants there is no

initiatives in promoting the staycation or holiday concept and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts security plans defining standard operating procedures social media plans etcwhat has caused the panicthis may seem obvious but its worth looking at this a bit closer the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants bars and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams theyd just denied many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very

painfully clear  there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases in the words of johan neyts professor of virology and president of the belgianbased international society for antiviral research isar health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early s partly because of the economic crisis of  which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existencethe way forwardall of these lessons come with a caveat  things change with time the modes of communication have changed both information  travel is much more accessible now we have fast planes  faster internet we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better if not perfect healthcare system in  people didnt even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication today we already have extensive research going on for  different probable vaccines for the virus with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvalswe are much better equipped than what we were  years ago and at the same time somewhat underequipped to deal with it but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times and if put to good use can aid in the fight against covid in the words of howard markel theres never

organization who the coronavirus disease which is called the covid is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus the covid virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways the covid disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over  years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and deathcommon symptoms includefevertirednessdry coughother symptoms includeshortness of breathaches and painssore throatand very few people in the world will report diarrhea nausea or a runny nosethe people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should selfisolate and contact their medical provider or a covid information line for advice on testing and referral the people who have a fever cough or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attentionsome key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus in the last  months there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infectionthe deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes terrible illness and death but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons some of them are as follows you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights being made to stay home however when it comes to the greater good one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom a balance between individual rights and public safety is an everchanging thing trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public you should wash your hands whether theres a virus or not general hygiene is always important not just when there is a virus you should know the drill by now wet your hands lather them with soap scrub for  seconds rinse off dry with a clean towel washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses working from home should be an option for many in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely without the virus in place there should still be some system in place that will promote worklife balance taking that sick day from the work could save lives if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation it is highly beneficial that you just stay home it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers this mentality needs to stop if you are sick just stay home the internet should be a basic right according to a study done by the university of birmingham the right to internet access also known as the right to broadband should be considered a human right many people from all over the world are unable to get online particularly the people who live in developing countries and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives in addition to this during times like these it is especially important to be able to contact family friends and work from home if necessary the internet is the only way to do so the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better if this scary time has taught us anything its that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world at the moment hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment it is high time for us that we need to reevaluate how much money hollywood actors proathletes and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve everyone should know how to cook the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn relearn or reignite their love for cooking learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life you depend on yourself it teaches you selfsustainability and you save a lot of money these days hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals they are rediscovering the wonders of eating in the importance of talking to friends every day now that we cant go out and keep busy the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family by chatting over the phone or video chatting this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations dont forget human connection during these crucial times call your grandma learn to appreciate nature if you live near a spacious outdoor area like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe surfaceless space to take a walk in then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is the point is not to remain indoors but to avoid being in close contact with others when you do leave your home whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands learn how to be content alone it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing being alone especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely social distancing can be very difficult but it can also teach you a lot about yourself you learn how to keep yourself busy your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with itconclusion it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be remembered by human beings in order to make the earth a beautiful place to live in lastly i would like to conclude by mentioning that stay at home stay safe save

gone through in the event lic lost most of the money several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market as was claimed by the finance ministry and that had the lic consulted the investment committee they would have pointed out mundhras forged shares episode from  the finance

insights  sandeep chakravartty publicis sapient ', 'it was th march and i wasaltogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me in the morning i made some lastminute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market it was not like i wasnt aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because theres a quote in theatre that says fear is only as deep as the mind allows and to some length i was fearless my passion fondness and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that were rolling outbut then at once i received a call from mr sandeep the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen the competition was postponed the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness this very sickness acted like a sadist i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me it has reversed the ways we used to work play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier intolerant and nonsupportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist but by all means our government knows how to best handle the affairs they decided to shut down schools colleges bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than  people with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other countryrelated issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problemwith fake news traveling around the world people come and start to blabber people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful peoplebut one thing that cant be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than  million many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many peoplemassive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus this statement takes my immediate attention what options are left with the dailywage earners i would say no option they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke but lockdown for them means an end to their life unquestionably this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think its a moment to question going to the internet and writing whats the best way to spend this quarantine should definitely be whats the best way in which we can help people but naturally this would not interest many people furthermore this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hungermy maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in  days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it  not only mala and her family but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition there are countless mala in our country who are panicking enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs imagine an exact same situation for yourselves it would without fail be the hardest situation this is the impact a virus can create for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to to this and each story ispainful that the otherlabor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates a very known movie in our indian cinemas is coolie that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will these stories will never end because its all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to themalso how one would imagine that the movie six feets apart would be acted in reality the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers roundtheclock solutions like washing your hands for at least  seconds correctly covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow the efforts of our doctors nurses government officials made me realize that my passion should not be above these notices and announcements but should move hand in hand with it right at this moment we all are moving with these circumstances and nobody knows what might happen in the future but one thing is of sure that nobody can ever forget this situation and indeed me as it had the ability to knock down my event that day many lessons were learned by all the world in these days some being that never ever take anything for granted because if that thing or that person leaves then life tends to become like a rock appreciate admire and cherish whatever you have because you never know when it might leave you ask from them who have just lost someone from this corona virus moments to live happily in this world are very few spend it with someone who makes you feel loved

much information to be hadthe chineseauthorities surely do not have all the answers at this point but theirinclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpfulsecond the lack of

rs  crore for  towards tax collections the collection as on stdec  was to the tune of rs  crore only with a clearly huge shortfall in addition a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to

consumerism and into governance policy and politics with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances making moves charged with a political motive and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to thereby begging the question  how wellplaced are personage in the world of politics should celebrities be allowed to join politicsthe interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policymakers have come into increasing contact in india and the rest of the worldleading popmusic artists back presidential candidates internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars and so on the influence that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement  at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils to represent the public that they once only influencedalthough the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the th century choi and berger  suggest that the celebritypolitics connect continues to strengthen much more than it did a few decades ago as we trudge further into the century of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance the global internet where fame isnt restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver in her  book hyde labels this spectacle as a mission creep where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goalsa prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace having already learned to live in the publics eye and established themselves allowing the carryover of their alreadyknown traits as celebrities into their role as policymakers the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere in one of the bestknown instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house carrying with him his trademark charismatic onscreen personality that spilled over into his politics initially serving as the governor of california for  years in the late s reagan served two terms at the oval office the voters knew who ronald was  those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue  but also those who did not giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success on the other side of the globe india saw much the same trend as an onscreen persona aiding the creation of an offscreen political career ramanand sagars television series ramayan based on the hindu mythological epic was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the s when television shows were still novel it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen every time arun govil who portrayed the deity ram made an appearance on screen having garnered a devout dutiful fan following govil and his other coactors from the show turned to the world of politics where their godly association in the publics eyes helped them make a mark even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity that their opponents lackvery often the sentiment of antiincumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians indeed various political theorists suggest that antiincumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks until st december  ukrainian actor screenwriter and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to change the mood and timbre of the political

poroshenko in a landslide victory has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor time is yet to deliver its verdict but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine and his plea to oust the ruling class played their role in assuring zelensky  of the plebiscite in the early s in india similar antiincumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani hockey legend dhanraj pillay singer jaspinder narula and others  all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwals aam aadmi movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its illsand so innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne in fact a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actorpolitician spanning the atlas claims that it may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness  depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politicsin a research article published in  meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular thereby failing to make any appreciable difference this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir a cricketerturnedpolitician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament hema malini another popular actress who turned to politics came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of womens rights wasnt backed by an effort to fulfill her promises owing to such instances research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt  find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver celebrity politicians often deprive grassroot political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politicshowever there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can in fact make their mark in the world of governance independent of their primary identities take the south indian state of tamil nadu for instance where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz for at least the last  years as per data from the ministry of statistics  programme implementation tamil nadu is amongst the topperforming states in the country having the secondhighest gdp most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber the late actorpolitician j jayalalithaa or amma ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu dr mg ramachandran continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his largescale reforms in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress including easing caste tensions and other communal violence mgr as he is better known is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screenmore often than not celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population empirical studies such as the one by austin vord pinkleton and epstein  have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters along similar lines jackson  found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians in fact many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic to be active participants in democracy hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboardtopping artists beyonce and jayz to take centerstage at her rally in cleveland in the weeks leading up to the  us presidential elections  in fact as multiple sources suggest this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters in such a case it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youthfrom our vantage point today the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay what remains to be done however is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship  to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and nonmaleficence to the public that it seeks to serve yet it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people  celebrity or not but in the world that we live in this is certainly not the case politicians  celebrity or not largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job ultimately like all things in democracy the government is of the people and its representatives are of them and for them the eventual endorsement of its leaders  celebrity or not  can come not from databased analyses and elaborate critique but from the people should celebrities be allowed to enter politics the question remains unanswered or rather is answered by the democratic exercise itself  with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election when the people  the real influencers

rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india from the s onwards the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india the healthcare system is organized into primary secondary and tertiary levels at the primary level are sub centres and primary health centres phcs at the secondary level there are community health centres chcs and smaller subdistrict hospitals finally the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level which consists of medical colleges and districtgeneral hospitals the number of phcs chcs sub centres and district hospitals has increased in the past six years although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards but there are still critical challenges to the existing systemone of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases especially communicable diseases among the general population of india this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society especially poor households migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts add low educational status poor functional literacy low accent on education within the healthcare system and low priority for health in the population among others and you see the magnitude of the problem according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iithyderabad and iitbombay in tier cities it was found that about  percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid this modal shift was about  percent in tier cities and about  percent in tier cities moreover nearly  percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march whereas  percent had the same frequency of travel to work when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation around  percent said they cancelled their flights whereas  per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys this indicates that awareness about covid is higher in tier cities in comparison with tier and tier cities but national level state level and doortodoor campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populacethe second challenge is access to public healthcare in india access to healthcare is defined by the oxford dictionary as the right or opportunity to use or benefit from healthcare physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access defined as  the ability to enter a healthcare facility within  km from the place of residence or work using this definition a study in india in  found that in rural areas only  of people were able to access ip facilities within a  km distance and  were able to access outpatient facilities furthermore it was postulated that in general the more rustic rural ones existence  the further one lives from towns  the greater are the odds of disease malnourishment weakness and premature deaththe third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic planning for a pandemic such as covid has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations which about a quarter of the population live in the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers an important part of the indian economy who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals who are fighting in the front of this pandemic of lack of protective personal equipments ppes to protect themselves and their patients from covid the lockdown has hit hiv and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition elderly people who are often alone and have medical conditions have been left without essential support ironically these are the same group

of the now pandemic we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan a city of  million people in chinas hubei province in late  cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february the peak of the epidemic there the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over  countries around the globebesides being a health crisis the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirusinduced global downturn to be way worse than financial crisis as the coronavirus spreads across the globe it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time economic inequality research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices according to the international labour organizationilo covid will have farreaching impacts on labor market outcomes beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensionsinitial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus based on different scenarios for the impact of covid on global gdp growth preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between  million low scenario and  million high scenario from a base level of  million in  the mid scenario suggests an increase of  million  million in highincome countries though these estimates remain highly uncertain all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment for comparison the global financial crisis of  increased unemployment by  million while selfemployment does not typically react to economic downturns it acts as a default option for survival or maintaining income  often in the informal economy for this reason informal employment tends to increase during crises however the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanismlabour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activityat this point a preliminary estimate suggests thatinfected workers have already lost nearly  work months with the consequent loss of income for unprotected workers employment impacts imply large income losses for workers overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between  and  billion usdthe loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient working poverty is also likely to increase significantlythe strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional  million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated ie an overall decline of  million working poor in  compared to a decline of  million estimated precovid under the mid and high scenarios there will be between  million and  million more people in working poverty than before the precovid estimate for who are particularly vulnerableepidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population which can trigger worsening inequalitybased on past experience and current information on the covid pandemic and insights from previous crises a number of groups can be identifiedthose with underlying health conditions and older peopleare most at risk of developing serious health issuesyoung persons already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment are more vulnerable to falling labor demand as witnessed during the global financial crisiswomenare overrepresented in more affected sectors such as services or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic eg nurses the ilo estimates that  percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world compared to  percent of menunprotected workers including the selfemployed casual and gig workers are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothingmigrant workersare particularly vulnerable to the impact of the covid crisis which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their familiesthe extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the worlds most vulnerable people including the world of work the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries where the most known cases are concentrated experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to lowincome countries to address the pandemic covid cases are more likely to go undetected or to be underdetected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic countries with large poor populations including brazil india indonesia nigeria and pakistan have confirmed few cases but have been slow to respond to the threat according to npr preventative care and health education areless accessibleto lowincome people who aremore likelyto have preexisting conditions catch covid and die from it people living in poverty are also more likely to holdinsecure jobsand cannot afford to stay home sick from workin times of crisis international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid on the world of work these standards adopted by representatives of governments workers and employers organizations provide a humancentered approach to growth and development including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprisespolicy responses should focus on two immediate goals health protection measures and economic support on both the demand and supplyside of the associated causefirst workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of covid protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened requiring largescale public support and investmentsecond timely largescale and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand these measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks eg losses in workers productivity capacities and demand shocks eg suppressing consumption among workers and their families that could lead to a prolonged economic recessionin such challenging times many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars protecting workers in the workplace stimulating the economy and labor demand and supporting employment and income some of the policies include working arrangements including telework occupational safety and health osh advice expanded access to paid sick leave prevention of discrimination and exclusion while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery it is clear that more needs to be done past crises and the experiences of countries which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid crisis show that preparedness and early action is criticalthe coronavirus pandemic is a test its a test of medical capacity and political will its a test of endurance and forbearance for believers a test of religious faith its a test too of a different kind of faith in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence questions so profound that they have previously been answered in many different ways by the greatest philosophers its a test of where all humans stand what is right and what is wrong what can individuals expect from society and what can society expect of them should others make sacrifices for me and vice versa is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease how long will we stay that way and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more

emotional connection with the consumer it develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers minds now if it takes great efforts to build such impression recognition and trust why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own handswe see hundreds of ads a day but only a few get noticed here is where a controversy comes into play we would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us so such ads stand out in controversy marketing a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick and the word spreads widely they believe that in order to stand out they cant play it safe always a controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses stating political opinions or presenting something that doesnt associate with their image etckey features of a wellcrafted controversial campaignchoosing the correct subject it could be a taboo or a debatable topic while both would be controversial a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topicthe campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself as a result the debate would be about the issue and not the brandthe campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion not a fight or abuse it should present the facts and avoid oversensitising the issuesno issuecurrent situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm if a controversy does not settle down early over the time it would become a part of the image of the companythe firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected

some will appreciate the message of the brand they will relate more to the brand and can become loyalistsstart a meaningful discussion particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society it breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about by communicating to the masses about such a topic the company eases the air which can lead to healthy discussionsboost sales the most important aspect if the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people it could boost sales and profitabilitydisadvantages of controversial marketingoffensive in present times the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone so we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversialruin brand reputation as stated earlier it puts a high risk on brand reputation for some consumers a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service specifically in case of media houses if a media house gets involved in controversies often then that reduces their credibilitywhile it can increase the awareness in a short span of time it wont work in the long run as this attention is short livedinternet they say anything that goes on the internet stays on the internet due to rise of social media people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything as a result even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten years from now if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeplya controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties if it ends up leading to disharmony in

marketing is a doubleedged sword on one side it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses and making more people conscious about the brand on the other it puts the brand value itself at

people live and work for several years to return china which felt the primary impact of the pandemic was an early mover during this space as home to a number of the worlds largest firms it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid crisis as companies told their employees to remain home around  million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday while this arrangement has some benefits like avoiding long commutes many employees and firms found it challenging one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from  to  meaning from nine to nine  days every week to all or any the time on the private front employees found it difficult to manage kids homeschooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues at an organization level many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly if done right remote working can boost productivity and morale done badly it can breed inefficiency damage work relationships and demotivate employees these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid on the world of workhere are a few of the learnings from china that will be applicable around the world looking at the circumstancesdesigning an effective structure due to the impacts of covid on the world of workteams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them resulting in holdups and delays thats why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital here smaller crossfunctional teams are helpful each with a transparent mission and reporting line where directions and tasks are easy to implement this also simplifies onboarding new hires who can integrate faster in a very tightknit group at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isnt visible or easy to feel with fewer in each team theres longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office at ping an insurance workers are typically grouped in project teams of at most  members while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile strong companywide foundations underpin this like having a typical purpose and unified goals providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four crossfunctional squads to support its frontline it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage frontline staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotelythe lesson putting in small crossfunctional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic courseleading from afar due to impacts of covid on the world of workmanaging people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the homeworking environment leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization its essential to foster an outcomedriven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open honest and productive communication empowering your team in this way pays dividendswesure a part of leading internet company tencent assembled a covid response team at the beginning of the year to supply amount freed from charge to frontline medical workersalan lau ceo of wesure credited his team saying that they had worked nonstop many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break demonstrating how responsive they were to the visionfor managers the challenge is to guide inspire and direct their team in their daily course of labor while being physically remote upping the amount of interaction can even work well here one chief information officer responding to a mckinsey survey said hes texting the whole company with regular updates because its a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels when working within distributed teams ecommerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its onetoone communications with employees to a weekly basis and in some teams members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues complete with plans for the week ahead alibabas productivity app dingtalk ding ding has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voicetotext messages to their teams and to test in on progressthe lesson determining how you communicate is simply as important as whats being said and it has to be done confidently consistently and reliablyinstilling a caring cultureas companies transition to the new normal its important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception including caring for his or her children when schools are shut resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity business leaders must respect and address these additional needs empathy may be a crucial tool here offering how to attach promote inclusiveness and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction increasing social interactions within the team particularly through oneonone catchup guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues being inclusive in deciding and offering perspective in challenging moments managers can stay closer to whats occurring surface issues and help their teams solve problems effectively a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently as an example one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with smallbusiness customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis to try and do so effectively at scale the managers are supported through dedicated product programs online articles scripts for communicating with clients and internal training inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy creating outlets for sharing best practices success stories challenges and watercooler chat are significant to making a persons connection giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors providing a transparent span of control and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivationthe lesson connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotelyfinding a new routinemoving to

team addressing the nuts and bolts of how youll work together cover the daily rhythm individual constraints and specific norms youll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way youll mitigate it how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetingsone leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams with a daily and weekly ritual of checkins sprint planning and review sessions as alibaba

fivestar system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools roles and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages reiteration of decisionmaking structures like this isnt always necessary when people can communicate directly but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks inthe lesson establishing robust working norms workflows and features of authority is critical but only too easy to stint onadopting a test and learn the strategythe final lesson being able to recognize what isnt working and changing it fastthese are the impacts of covid on the world of work leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future rd teams at one leading hightech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it within four weeks they had progressed from  percent to  percent of their baseline as chinas workforce begins to return to offices these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of howwith the correct structure culture processes and technologyworking remotely can boost productivity and morale employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better worklife balance are likely to be happier more motivated and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations embracing remote working allows companies to

trading payscale and positioning in the military had beendone through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation and many were ready to accept the british so the marketing is like fire when smartlyhandled it can destroy your enemies but when not it can burn you marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product price place and promotion strategies marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly boiling down to vital three these are what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on based on gender age location customerclass w what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer w what is your product promotion flow path w how much time it takes to convey product information to customer h these criteria are what i call wh forms these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product however are they enough no there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism fm generally machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not the input is corrected to get the required output when it comes to human beings heshe is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media tv advertising and so forth slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumers mind in the feedback mechanism the marketing team needs to answer only one question what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities if the product image not built as per expectation then management has to review and work on wh as discussed earlier so lets elaborate how wh approach works along with feedback mechanism           fig wh with fm process can target customer effectively          after deciding the customer range you can work on otheractivities since the customer isconscious about purchasing the product andwhen the product promoted the first thing the customer will check is itsusefulness and if hisher answer is yesthen the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in themarket therefore one should present theproduct along with some unique thoughtand express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumermind for example the polio campaign inindia the government had taken the initiative to make india poliofree byspreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums in whichtelevision played a vital role legendarycinema actor amitabh bachchan was selected as an ambassador for this campaigninitially the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinatingthe children within a fixed schedule the advertisement circulated throughout the nation andno stone was kept unturned by the governmentto make this campaign successful howevermuch to the surprise advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth this promotion failure was because ofnonconsideration of the customer wand how advertise impacted its application on the customer w so after analysing failure experts recommended changesin their marketing campaign like to focus on major customer here mainlyvillage woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv type ofimpact on people people who watched tv during that era had an image ofamitabh as angry young man so the campaignimproved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead ofhis softimage which used in the earlier campaign so in a very next poliocampaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and whenfeedback is taken from people about such a sudden change they replied that wedont want to watch amitabh sir getting angry because of usiinw organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer currentlythere are a lot of platforms available bywhich you can market your product the mainagenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customerthrough marketing at very first if you make animpact on customer then only he can show interest in your product forexample changes in launching trailers ofthe upcoming films till thcentury television and newspaper were crucialfactors but now along with television marketing team take help of internetresources like youtube facebookintroducing an article on the pretrailer phenomenon increasing the range of promotional devices broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the boxoffice forthe last factor h time the obvious question that comes to mind is that is time for advertising matters whilewatching the tv when an advertisement appearsmany times we change the channel instead ofwatching the whole ad or ignore it altogether you do have an option of skip ad when you watch anything online so one must decide how much time is requiredto deliver product information during itspromotion delivering product informationin less time may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so itcan result in attracting more customers so the content will be theking in the marketing however as onemust have guessed it this will not work all the time other factors like the cost of the productapplication range type of customer can also affectthe h for example the customer would bemore conscious while watching higherpricedproduct broadcast compare to the lowerpriced one so it would take more timefor the marketing team to convince thecustomer to buy the expensive good than the lowerpriced oneafterimplementing a marketing strategy as per wh we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information aboutproduct image generated in customers minds through dealers and using feedbackform not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achievingproduct sales target and can make the situation even worse take the example of the tata nanomaking of worldscheapest car which was mindblowing oneofakind projects in indianautomobile industry from the first phase of a marketingcampaign tata nano was on so muchcontinuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american presidentbarack obamaiithe curiosity about the productwas so high that the sale of thenleadingcar model maruti was dropped by  immediately after unveiling the nanoiiihowever while marketing the product an organization built affordable garibo ki car image in customers mindwhich made customers conscious about what will be their statusquo in societyafter buying nano thus they started giving preference to twowheelers over nano during the same time some instances of nanos catching fire cameinto focus which worsened the situationthis case even exacerbates when the teamdid not work on the feedback mechanismand hence was not able to change customerperception about nano later when nano fire problem was technically sorted outbut even then the marketing team did notmake any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car therefore customers negative perceptionremained stuck and the organization didnot even come close to achieving sellingfigures of

remember ive been thinking of prompts to prevent face touching such as wearing fabric gloves when out and about but i dont want to promote this unless the fabric is atleastnoworse than hands for transferring the virus between surfacesim talking about use in the community for instance when people have to travel or go to food shops not in a healthcare context the gloves should be changed between different settings eg apartment block bus shop  switch to a new pair of gloves for each the gloves should be ironed hot at the end of each dayas far as i can tell from my attempts searching this is evidencebased but im keen to know from someone who is better at interpreting evidence in this field if it is sensible use fabric gloves to avoid spreading of coronavirus from outside every person going out for daily work touching every were using these gloves before entering the house remove the glove outside the home and clean hand with sanitizer to kill the virus use of this glove to wash with sanitizer and bowling in water about  to c is put outside the home for drying in night time morning these gloves are used any time you go outside and come back come do this is the better way

causes related to the immune response of il and macrophages or would other types of scenarios be related to some environmental element il is a marker for macrophages as an essential and preinflammatory marker but my question is not directed at that already known factor but what i am asking is the reason for such a brutal response by the immune systemfor example here in spain one of the parallel treatments is the administration of corticosteroids and antiinflammatory drugsand another of the most worrying markers in patients is the increase in ferritin or that its values are out of range the exacerbated response of the immune system specifically il which in addition to being preinflammatory also has an antiinflammatory function depending on which synergies occur with its two types of receptors ril and gp  this acts as an antagonist these types of proteins are very typical in endothelial cells or in macrophagesbut my question is why this so severe call of il and il by those affected by covidcould it be that the viruss nexus protein had some synergy with ril binding to it and in this case it was acting as an agonist and to act making a call effect i dont knowmy question is directed more at him why of that abrupt and exaggerated call and in such a short timecould it have to do with the virus replication speed vs slower activation speed of t and b lymphocytesin innate immunity monocytes in this case macrophages are cells that present il in their cell membranes but such a large amount  of responseit is as if the immune response is more associated with cellular damage damp whyeven soluble peptides like cathelicidins hdps that react and are produced by cells of the epithelial tissue of the respiratory digestive system or the skin itself which are pro and antiinflammatory and they also act as chemoattraction agents proapoptosis in the case of epithelial cells and antiapoptotic in the case of neutrophils they are one more

would limit the usage of the network to only those who can afford itthis will eventually lead to fewer validations for the distributed ledger defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain a

using a basic broadband connectioninhomesmall business computers if two people have personal transactionhistory its unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain everytime a transaction

this technology is really fascinating and has a very broad usage through the implementation of bitcoins and distributed ledger in everyday life once this is rolled out for customer experience

services that were never provided big data analytics can help an insurance company to discover these frauds big data can use a huge amount of historical data to identify expected procedure or service for reported illness identified using diagnosis code if the expected procedure code doesnt match with a billed procedure code insurance companies can tag claim as a potential fraud claim once a claim is tagged as a fraud claim the manual examiner needs to do additional verification to ensure that the claim is submitted by fraud providersometimes patients fake identity to get the benefit of insurance using big data companies can match patients information with services heshe has taken if services taken by the patient is very different from the past medical history of patients analytics can tag claim as one of the susceptible fraud claimsstoring of datatraditional health care providers find it difficult to store a vast amount of data more ever traditional database stores only structured data big data can solve storage issue by handling huge volume and variety of data having historical data of the patient can reduce healthcare drastically improving scheduling of appointmentsit is very tough to get a physicians appointment in developed countries one of my friends senior director in a multinational bank got an appointment for hip replacement surgery with a waiting period of six months he was not able to sit and as a result he didnt drive or come to the office for six months the waiting period can be drastically reduced if the hospital is able to forecast the number of patients likely to miss appointments based on historical data hospitals can predict the number of no shows and can accordingly schedule appointments so as not to miss any slot because of no showsreducing overpayment and underpayment made tohospitalif a health insurance company pays an amount to hospitalprovider that is greater than the contracted amount for service payment is called an overpayment similarly if payment made is lesser than the contracted amount for service payment is called an underpayment overpayment or underpayment is a big headache for both insurance companies and patients according to aha data private insurance companies have consistently overpaid hospitals for inpatient care for more than three decades these overpayments have varied significantly over the years but have grown dramatically in the past few years overpayment or underpayment can happen because of multiple reasons such as system glitch a coding error using cognitive analysis big data can predict the payment amount if the predicted payment amount is significantly different than the actual payment amount the system can identify possible overpayments or underpayments predictive treatmentthroughout the world healthcare is based on diagnosing the presence of disease and subsequently treating the disease if present early diagnosis of the illness is a major challenge patients do go for diagnosis only when the symptom is evident it becomes challenging for the physician to treat illness once illness grows beyond a certain levelpredictive or preventive can help to identify if an individual will develop a disease different forms of health device such as iwatch can capture data and send to the hospital at regular interval of time using predictive analysis the hospital can predict if a patient is likely to develop an illness early diagnosis of illness can help doctors to treat patients effectively and at a lower cost predictive treatment can reduce the number of days a patient needs to be admitted in the hospital as inpatient treatment is costlier than outpatient treatment doctors can discharge patients if heshe thinks that the condition of the patient is not serious the hospital can monitor the patient remotely using medical sensors and can call the patient to the hospital when it is required big data plays a big role when a person suffers from multiple illnesses as per dr abhishek rai ms ortho of kem medical college mumbai it becomes challenging to operate patients when he suffers from multiple illnesses many a number of times physicians are not aware of all issues with patients as patients themselves are not aware of all illness as an example its tough to operate on a person suffering from diabetes as blood doesnt coat easily for a diabetic person if a physician doesnt have historical data of a diabetic person heshe may operate diabetic person wrongly another example where big data analytics can play a huge role in predicting disease is a genetic disease if a person has breast cancer her child is  percent likely to develop breast cancer using big data analytics the system can identify patients likely to suffer from genetic disease and request patients to do timely screening genetic diseases can be screened in first second or thirddegree relatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality timely diagnostic reportsin india it takes  days on an average to get an mri scan delay is not because of lack of medical instruments but because of lack of qualified radiologists this problem can be mitigated by integrating medical imaging with big data integration of medical imaging with big data will ensure that radiologists get the report in a short span of time big data will help not only to reduce the turnaround time required to get reports but also to get better reports technology can convert image to graphs and charts making it easier for radiologists to read the report as data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity so the more data we have the better the outcomes can be obtained thus big data technology is clearly the digital disruptor to revolutionize the healthcare sector by consolidating the data from disparate platforms to build a degree view about the human body and help the healthcare provider to generate solutions to lifethreatening problems and improved healthcare opportunitiesblackcoffer insights   prakhar kaushik and vivek rai iim calcutta', 'analytics is a statistical scientific process of discovering and presenting the meaningful patterns that can be found in data while business analytics refers to the skills technologies applications practices computer programming and operations research for the continuous exploration of data to gain insight that drives business decisionsbusiness analytics technologyis helping healthcare organizations regulate existing data to improve clinical and business operations in addition to this analytics help to identify the symptoms of diseases in preliminary stages itself along with suggesting possible remedies for the same without any need of the intervention of a human being with the help of analytics and chatbots patient can now look for expert doctor advice in the comfort of their home free of charge in most of the cases with as easy accessibility as onetouch from your smartphonesaccording tothe survey conducted by health catalyst a whopping  of the respondentsadmitted that analytics is going to be either extremely important or veryimportant to their organization within the next few years and the respondentsalso rated the importance of healthcare trends and the role played by analyticsin themanalytics is thus becoming very crucial in tracking different types of healthcare trends advanced analytics touches every aspect ofhealthcare software systemsincluding clinical operational and financial sectorsthe role of analytics in transforming healthcarehealthcare organizations have begun to adopt technologies like pacs imaging systems and emrs or electronic health records that attempts to make sense of the massive data that flows through the system both structured and unstructured hence it is important to know what are the tools that can extract information from the data to generate value and enjoy operational financial and clinical insightsthere are genome analyzers and other analytics tools in the market that help in understanding the facts and eliminate unwanteduseless details to extract only whats needed the end result of this is better clinical outcomes for the patient there are several ways in which healthcare organizations can make use of information collected through various sourcesdisease surveillance and preventative

penalties whilesimultaneously addressing important aspects of patient treatment and careanalyticsare changing roles in the healthcare industry an increasing number of informed patients are taking more responsibility for their own care likewise physicians are finding more satisfaction with their positions as positive effects increase more time spent with individual patients has increased which gives physicians the chance to form a trusted relationship with the patient physicians want to spend time with their patients  to know them interact with them and help them when the time to develop a relationship is diminished the physician is less satisfied with his or her professionanalytics haschanged the way the healthcare world operates with the ability totransform the way medicine has been

and models to go with itblackcoffer insights   tanmay shrivastava and vishnu bajpai international management institute', 'big datato begin with i shall first like to explain what big data is and why it has become so important in our lives big data is simply data but with a huge size data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools so how huge can this data be social media sites like facebook generate more than  terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos video uploads text messages etc a singlejet enginecan generatemore than  terabytesof data in minutesof flight time with many thousand flights per day generation of data reaches up to manypetabytes data contained in these sets are not always structured it can be semistructured or even unstructured when such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it therefore modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data setsopportunities  now coming to the opportunities that big data provides they are not just limited to healthcare big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth healthcare is no exception big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care however when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially in india many times we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients for instance when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate we can easily gauge our helplessness however the scenario is certainly improving now with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situationsapart from reduced er visits and timely treatment there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis patients with highrisk lifethreatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities due to lack of data there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals under or overbooking of staff lack of medical equipment medicines and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and illmanagement of finances using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones it may lead to incorrect decisions this is known as recency bias big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies challenges  while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation one of the biggest challenges is security healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients acts of hacking cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money protection of the patients privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation also the data would contain external data apart from medical information the organization therefore has to take care of privacy legal compliances and government policies privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permittedthe next challenge is data classification and modeling the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult storage and retrieval is another major challenge huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data also the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hasslefree the way storage is a challenge retrieval also is a matter of concern integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job the next challenge is a major one in my opinion finding the righttalent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduoustask shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today even afterhiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them scarce resources likedata scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain they are easilypoached by competitors a good and efficient compensation strategy conducivework environment high incentives opportunities for career growth and developmentcan be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent in a nutshell we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibilityblackcoffer insights   subhasmita dey xavier school of human resource management xub']\n"
